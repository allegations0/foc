:: LORE_race_lizardkin [nobr]

<p>
The most populous species of the relatively rare <<rep setup.trait.race_lizardkin>>.
Although rarely found within <<lore geo_mestia>>, they are a rather common sight
far beyond the <<lore region_sea>>.
They share many traits with their close relative, the <<rep setup.trait.subrace_dragonkin>>,
being a big, tall, proud, brave, and dominant species, but unlike the dragonkin, lizardkin are also
quite aggressive, and would take jobs such as raiders and thugs that dragonkin abhor with passion.
They are quite <<rep setup.trait.skill_intimidating>> to look at.
Lizardkin are excellent swimmers, and many are attuned to <<lore magic_water>>.
