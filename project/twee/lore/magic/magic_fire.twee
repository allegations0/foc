type of flame.
Those gifted in <<rep setup.trait.magic_fire_master>> are able to conjure purifying flames,
which can negate and counteract the demonic corruptions plaguing the land.
These people often use their gifts by travelling the land as purifiers, offering their
purifying services for a token fee to the needy.

<<rep setup.trait.subrace_orc>> living in the encampments to the east, you are bound to encounter
a formidable fire wizard sooner or later in the deserts.
And you will certainly need their help, for the desert is littered with
the <<lore concept_mist>> which connects this world with the corrupted demonic world.
