<p>
A long time ago, long before the <<lore race_neko>> become the dominant species
of the catkin,
the <<lore race_tigerkin>> and the <<lore race_elf>> were engaged in a bitter,
decades long war.
Accounts of the war are mixed. The elves call it the Sylvan-Catkin war, while
the tigerkin and Neko know it as the War of the Open Paw, and the accounts only diverge more from there.
The scars of the war remain scattered throughout the <<lore region_forest>>
to this day, and many ruins, both elven and catkin have been swallowed up by the forest.

<p>
Both the tigerkin and the elves of old were master of the <<lore magic_earth>>,
but they use it in fairly different ways.
The tigerkin use the magic to enhance their combat prowess, while the elves opted for more subtle applications.
Perhaps the most infamous elven spell was that of petrification -- the ability
to turn flesh to stone -- which was responsible for the many petrified tigerkin
statues one could found deep within the forests.
The magic has been lost to the ages, however, which is probably a good thing.
