You enter the armory.
<<if _storage>>
  It has been expanded with <<= _storage>> storages.
<</if>>
Currently, you have <<successtext _sets.length>>
equipment sets, out of a maximum of
<<= _max>> sets.
<<if _sets.length >= _max>>
  It might be a good idea to keep a few vacant spots, in case you obtain
  some new equipment sets from quests.
  You can obtain more slots by upgrading your <<rep _room>>.
<</if>>
You remember that your slavers 
<<message 'refuse to wear slutty clothings'>>
  <div class='helpcard'>
    Most slavers will refuse to wear clothes whose Sluttiness
    rating is <<= setup.EQUIPMENT_SLAVER_SLUTTY_LIMIT_NORMAL >> or higher.
    On top of this,
    <<rep setup.trait.per_chaste>> slavers will refuse to wear
    even slightly slutty clothings, while
    <<rep setup.trait.per_lustful>> or <<rep setup.trait.per_sexaddict>> might
    be willing to wear sluttier clothings.
  </div>
<</message>>, but there are no such
restriction for your slaves or even you, if you are willing.
Some equipments also have restrictions on who can possibly use them.
