  the incredibly rare <<rep setup.equipment.combat_arms_master>>.
<<elseif _favor >= setup.FAVOR_EFFECT_THRESHOLDS[1]>>
  You have maintained friendly relations with the rough-and-tumble orcs of <<rep $company.orc>>.

  You have maintained warm relations with the rough-and-tumble orcs of <<rep $company.orc>>.
