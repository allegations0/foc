<<if _favor >= setup.FAVOR_EFFECT_THRESHOLDS[2]>>

<<if _god>>

    <<set _company = setup.dutytemplate.questlivinggod.getFavorCompany()>>
    <<they _god>> would hold divine sermons for <<their _god>> worshippers, who are mostly from
    <<rep _company>>. This indirectly helps the reputation of your company among these people.
  <<else>>
    <<they _god>> would hold speeches for <<their _god>> worshippers, including asking
    for a generous amount of tithe, some of which goes into your company's coffers.
