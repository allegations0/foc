  You enter the mission control room, where you can view your teams that are currently going on a mission.

      You noticed your <<rep _rescuer>> <<rep _unit>> sitting on
      <<their _unit>> desk busy looking for your lost slavers,

    <<elseif _unit>>
      <<Yourrep _unit>> usually works here, but <<they _unit>>
      is currently unavailable to attend to <<their _unit>> duties.
    <<else>>
      A room has been set aside for your <<rep _rescuer>> to work,
      but it's empty now.

    <<set _unit = _insurer.getAssignedUnit()>>
    <<if _unit && _unit.isAvailable()>>
      You can see numerous contingency plans
      scribbled all over your
      <<rep _insurer>> <<rep _unit>>'s desk.
      The <<man _unit>> <<themself _unit>> is nowhere to be seen however,
      probably busy trying to secure all the necessary precautions,
      <<= setup.Text.Duty.competence(_insurer)>>.
    <<elseif _unit>>
      <<Yourrep _unit>> usually works here, but <<they _unit>>
      is currently unavailable to attend to <<their _unit>> duties.
    <<else>>
      The workstation for your <<rep _insurer>> is currently unoccupied.

  <<if _lockers>>
    The mission control room has been upgraded <<= _lockers>> times.
  <</if>>
  Currently,
  <<= _teams.length>> teams are away on a mission.
  You can have at most
  <<successtext $company.player.getMaxActiveTeams()>> different teams on a mission at the same time.
  If you want to increase this limit, you can upgrade your <<rep _room>>.
  You proceed to sit on a desk to view your teams.
