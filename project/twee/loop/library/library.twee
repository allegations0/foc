<p>
You enter the grand library of your fort.
It is furnished full with books, whose origin you never actually know.
The <<message 'map of the region'>>
  <<worldmap>>
<</message>> is framed on one of the walls.
<<if _u && !_u.isYou()>>
  <<Yourrep _u>> is here right now.
  <<if _u.isHasTrait('per_studious')>>
    Not really surprising given <<their _u>> diligent nature.
  <<elseif _u.isHasTrait('per_curious')>>
    The inquisitive slaver always enjoys a good read or two.
  <<elseif _u.isHasTrait('per_smart')>>
    No doubt <<their _u>> frequent trip to the library is contributing to <<their _u>>
    intelligence.
  <<elseif _u.isHasTrait('per_slow')>>
    It seems that despite being a little slow, <<they _u>> is clearly trying to improve.
  <<elseif _u.isHasTrait('per_active')>>
    A surprising fact -- you have never known the active slaver to enjoy reading books.
  <<elseif _u.isHasTrait('per_stubborn')>>
    You sighed, knowing that sooner or later the stubborn slaver will give up reading the book and throw it away.
  <<elseif _u.isHasTrait('per_evil')>>
    <<They _u>>'s probably reading a book about world domination or two.
  <<elseif _u.isHasTrait('per_dreamy')>>
    From the drool coming from <<their _u>> <<umouth _u>>, the air-headed slaver
    seems to be enjoying a good day-dream.
  <<else>>
    You walked quietly to try and not disturb the slaver's reading.
  <</if>>
<<else>>
  Nobody is in the library right now.
<</if>>
  You pick an empty seat and begin to plan what you would like to read today.
