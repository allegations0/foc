  <h2><<= _room.getTitleRep()>></h2>

  You enter the <<rep _room>> of your fort <<= $fort.player.rep() >>.
  Various blueprints for both future and existing improvements are posted along the walls of this office,
  as well as upgrades for your fort.

  <<set _level = State.variables.fortgrid.getTotalExpansions()>>
  <<if _level == 0>>
    It is still the same ruined fortress you first resided in.
  <<elseif _level <= 5>>
    You have done your first couple of upgrades on your fort, making it slightly more livable.
  <<elseif _level <= 10>>
    You have cleared the rubbles surrounding the center part of the fort.
  <<elseif _level <= 20>>
    Most of the smaller rubbles have been cleared out, and your fort is starting to look livable.
  <<elseif _level <= 30>>
    Most of the rubbles have been cleared from your fort, and it's starting to look presentable.
  <<elseif _level <= 40>>
    You have starting to fix some of the broken infrastructures in the fort back to working condition.
  <<elseif _level <= 50>>
    All of the rubbles have been cleared from your fort, restoring it to its previous state.
  <<elseif _level <= 60>>
    Repairs are made on the fort's secondary level, adding available space to your fort.
  <<elseif _level <= 70>>
    Some of the fort's structures have collapsed, and rebuilding efforts are underway for these sections.
  <<elseif _level <= 80>>
    The collapsed regions of the fort have almost entirely been repaired, restoring the fort to what it was once.
  <<elseif _level <= 90>>
    New structures are starting to be erected to make space for more improvements.
  <<elseif _level <= 100>>
    New structures decorated your fort, increasing space available.
  <<elseif _level <= 120>>
    You are starting to build your fort into the surrounding lands, incurring great costs.
  <<elseif _level <= 140>>
    Your fort has expanded beyond its original scope, and expansion is still ongoing.
  <<elseif _level <= 160>>
    Palisades are rebuild as you expand your fort's region beyond what it originally started with.
  <<elseif _level <= 180>>
    Your fort now spans a large region including a large open field where your slavers can relax together.
  <<elseif _level <= 200>>
    Small settlements start to spring around your gigantic fort.
  <<elseif _level <= 220>>
    Your fort is effectively a small village by this point.
  <<elseif _level <= 240>>
    A bustling town surrounds your fort
  <<elseif _level < 250>>
    Your fort is almost at the maximum possible size, with townfolks busily attending their business all around.
  <<else>>
    Your fort is fully upgraded. Together with the surrounding settlement, it truly deserve to be called a proper city.

    <div class='helpcard'>
    Improvements are the main way you progress in the game.
    Most improvement comes with a room, and
    you will need to place the improvement on the fort map.
    Many of the improvement unlocks a new menu on the left sidebar --- which unlocks a new part
    of the game.

<h2>Build an improvement</h2>

    <p>
      You can build various improvements from this menu.
      At the moment, only the <<rep setup.buildingtemplate.scouthut>> is available
      for you to build, but as you progress in the game and gather more money,
      you will be able to afford more options.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click <<successtext "Build">> next to the "Scout Hut" to proceed.
      Alternatively, you can click <<successtext "Build and auto-place">> to automatically
      place the building on your fort, if there are enough space for it.
    </p>

<<elseif $calendar.getWeek() == 2>>

    <p>
      With the <<rep setup.buildingtemplate.scouthut>> built, you should now return to the

      Have fun!
