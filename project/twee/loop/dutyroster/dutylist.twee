<p>
This simple but functional room has a large board
at the back of the room, containing duty assignments for the week.
<<if !_trainer>>
Once you unlock the Drill Sergeant duty from the
<<rep setup.buildingtemplate.traininggrounds>>, then
slavers on duties will gain experience each week.
<<else>>
  <<set _unit = _trainer.getAssignedUnit()>>
  <<if _unit && _unit.isAvailable()>>
    From the window you can see
    your <<rep _trainer>> <<rep _unit>> instilling discipline
    to your on-duty slavers,
    <<= setup.Text.Duty.competence(_trainer)>>.
    This will give all on-duty slavers some experience
    each week.
  <<elseif _unit>>
    Normally, youur <<rep _trainer>> <<rep _unit>> is busy instilling discipline
    to the rest of your slavers. But <<they _unit>> is unavailable right now.
  <<else>>
    You can see your <<rep setup.buildingtemplate.traininggrounds>> from the windows of this room,
    but it is empty right now. You should assign a <<rep _trainer>> so that your home slavers
    can get experience.

<<set _tmproom = $fort.player.isHasBuilding('specialistoffice')>>
<<if _tmproom>>
  The neighboring room has been designated as the <<rep setup.buildingtemplate.specialistoffice>>,where
  contractual specialists can work in lieu of your on-duty slavers when they are busy,
  although these specialists command a hefty pay.
  <<set _replaced = $dutylist.getDuties().filter(duty => duty.isSpecialistActive())>>
  <<if _replaced.length>>
    Currently, there 
    <<if _replaced.length > 1>>
      are <<= _replaced.length>> duties that are
    <<else>>
      is one duty that is
    <</if>>
    currently being staffed by these specialists, costing you
    <<set _money = _replaced.length * setup.DUTY_SPECIALIST_WEEKLY_UPKEEP>>
    <<money _money>>
    each week.
  <</if>>

<<else>>
  Slavers on duty can only perform their duties when they are available,
  although you may have another option once you build the <<rep setup.buildingtemplate.specialistoffice>>.

Would you like to make changes to the unit duty assignments?
