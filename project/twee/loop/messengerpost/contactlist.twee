You enter the small building right at the entrance of your fort.
It is here that you receive messages and order messengers to come and
deliver your messages.
<<if _contacts.length >>
  You check on your list of contacts and see if there is anything you'd like to do.
<<else>>
  As you have no contacts right now, there is nothing to be done here.
