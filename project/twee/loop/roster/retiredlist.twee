You enter the lodgings area designated as the guest rooms.
You can host your guests here, including
<<if _unitlist.length > 1>>
your former slavers when they decide to revisit your fort.
<<elseif _unitlist.length == 1>>
<<yourrep _unitlist[0]>>.
<<else>>
slavers that you may retire in the future.
<</if>>
<<if _room && _room.getLevel() > 1>>
It has been extended with <<= _room.getLevel() - 1>> additional rooms.
<</if>>
<<if _unitlist.length>>
Currently, you have <<successtext _unitlist.length>>
retired slaver<<if _unitlist.length > 1>>s<</if>>
that you are keeping contacts with, out of a maximum of
<<= _maxretired>> retired slavers.
<</if>>
<<if _unitlist.length >= _maxslavers>>
If you want to keep track of more, consider
furnishing more rooms by upgrading
your <<rep _room>>, or by removing contact with some of your retired slavers.

  <div class='helpcard'>
    Once your slaver has stayed with you for long enough time and obtained the
    <<rep setup.trait.join_senior>> trait, instead of dismissing them,
    you can also end their services by retiring them instead.
    You will continue to keep in touch with retired slavers, and they
    can be viewed in this menu.
