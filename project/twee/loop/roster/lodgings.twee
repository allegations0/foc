<p>
You enter the area of your fort which has been designated as the de facto lodgings area of your fort.
<<if _room && _room.getLevel() > 1>>
It has been extended with <<= _room.getLevel() - 1>> additional rooms.
<</if>>
There are currently <<successtext _unitlist.length>> slavers residing here out of 
a maximum of <<= _maxslavers>> slavers.
<<if _unitlist.length >= _maxslavers>>
If you want to hire more slavers, consider furnishing more rooms by upgrading
your <<rep setup.buildingtemplate.lodgings>>.
<</if>>
You remember that you can interact with your slavers if you ever want to change their skill focuses,
which determines which skill they gain on level up.

<<if $fort.player.isHasBuilding('warroom')>>

  <<if _need.length>>
    <p>
      There are <<dangertext _need.length>> slavers who <<successtext 'can learn a new perk'>>.
      You should assign new perks to them, or you can
      <<foclink '(Auto Assign)'>>
        <<run setup.Unit.autoAssignPerks()>>
        <<focgoto>>
      <</foclink>>.

    <p>
      Welcome to the roster screen. You can interact and customize with your slavers here.
      The most important menu that you need to learn is perhaps the <<successtext "Skill focus">>
      menu. Using this menu, you can change how the units will progress their skills as they level up.
      Click on any of the Skill Focus menu to try it out!
