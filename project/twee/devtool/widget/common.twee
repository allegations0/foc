Your new $args[0] is ready!
It is advisable to <<successtext 'save your game now'>>, so you don't lose your progress,
and you can continue to work on this $args[0] later if you want to revise it.
Click the (Test your $args[0]) link to test your $args[0]:
You can also <<message 'test your content in a real game'>>
  <div class='helpcard'>
    To test your $args[0] in a real game, you must have an existing saved game right now.
    Click the "(Test your $args[0])" button below. Once the $args[0] test results shows up,
    <<dangertext 'in that same screen'>>, load your save from the SAVES menu at the bottom left.
    Your $args[0] is now in that game!
    If you want to add multiple $args[0]s to test in the game, you can do so by following the
    (Click for guide on how to add it to the game code yourself) guide below.

When you are happy with your $args[0] and no error appeared in the (Test your $args[0]) above,
you are ready to add the $args[0] to the game!
There are two options for you.
The first option is to copy paste all the code below to the [[subreddit|https://www.reddit.com/r/FortOfChains/]],
and a contributor will put it in the game code.
(Hint: your code is likely to exceed reddit's word limit. In this case,
paste your code to [[ghostbin|https://ghostbin.co/]],
then paste the resulting link to reddit.)
(If you use Discord, you can tell us your discord name too in the submission
so we can give you a Discord role,
which among other things allows you to bypass the seven days wait required there.)
The second option is to add it to the code directly, and it's also very easy!
<<set _filename = `project/twee/${$args[0]}/[yourname]/${$qfilename}`>>
<<message "Click for guide on how to add it to the game code yourself">>
  <div class='helpcard'>
    <p>
    First, go to https://gitgud.io/darkofocdarko/fort-of-chains and download the repository.
    Next, create the following file:
    <<successtext _filename>>,
    and copy paste all the code later below to that file.
    (Replace [yourname] with your name. You can use any text editor like
    [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) to create the file.
    You may need to create a new directory here.
    Make sure the file ends with ".twee", instead of ".txt" or any other extension.
    )
    [[(Example)|https://gitgud.io/darkofocdarko/fort-of-chains/-/blob/master/project/twee/quest/Dporentel/goblin_resque.twee]]
    Finally, compile the game, which is really easy! See [[here|https://gitgud.io/darkofocdarko/fort-of-chains#compiling-instructions]]
    for compiling instructions.
    </p>

    <p>
    That's all.
    Your $args[0] is now permanently in the game (in your copy of the game that is).
    You can
    test your $args[0] after you compile by going to the Debug Start, then go to Settings, then to "Test $args[0]".
    <<if $args[0] == 'quest'>>
      Your $args[0] will be at their corresponding pool (or at "Other Quests" if it does not belong to any pool).
    <</if>>
    Once that works, all you need to do is
    [[send a merge request to the repository|https://gitgud.io/darkofocdarko/fort-of-chains/-/blob/master/docs/mergerequest.md]].
    (Again, you don't need to install anything to do so.)
