<div class='helpcard'>
  When seeded, the randomness is determined by the quest's "seed" value.
  Each quest will be assigned a random seed value at the start, but this value will not
  change throughout the quest.
  This seed value is then modulo'd by the number of outcomes, to determine which one to get.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For example, with three outcomes, then the first outcome will occur when

  """
  gQuest.getSeed() % 3 == 0,
  """

  the second outcome will occur when

  """
  gQuest.getSeed() % 3 == 1,
  """

  and the third outcome will occur when

  """
  gQuest.getSeed() % 3 == 2
  """

  This can then be used during writing, so you can write the quest based on which outcome.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  You can condition upon this in Content Creator, by going to: This, then If... seed.
