<<Rep $g.a>> returned to the life of crime.
a|They would visit taverns and shops and demand money, but unlike before,
a|their threats feel much more genuine now.
a|They now knows the full depravity of what one could do to another, having worked
in a slaving company, and a|they used it to full effect in a|their intimidations.
<<if $g.a.isHasTrait('skill_intimidating')>>
a|Their intimidating skills helped a lot too.
<<elseif $g.a.isHasTrait('face_scary')>>
a|Their a|face helped a lot too.
