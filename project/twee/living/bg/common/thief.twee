<p>
Having secured a significant chunk of money,
<<rep $g.a>> decided to
pursue a|their long-held dream
of becoming an honorable thief.
Oh yes, the kind that steals from the rich and give away to the poor.
They would infiltrate the many rich mansions of the <<lore region_city>>,
stealing valuables and slaves alike, and while the valuables are given to the poor,
it is unknown what happens to the slaves.
Rumors said that a|they used a|their considerably wealth to buy a mansion in a secluded
area in the <<lore region_vale>> for who-knows-what...
