<<Rep $g.a>> decided to
<<if $g.a.isHasTrait('bg_soldier')>>
return to being a soldier, this time
<<else>>
try a|their a|hands at being a proper soldier, but
<</if>>
not for the money, but rather for the thrill that comes with the job.
a|They spends most of a|their time drilling and practicing,
and it was obvious to a|their superiors that the a|race is so much better at combat
than the average person.
a|They would quickly rise up the ranks, and become a respected soldier in the army.
