:: LIVING_raider [nobr]

<p>
Despite having accumulated enough money to retire, it seems that <<rep $g.a>>
did not raid for the money, and the a|race resumed raiding by simply joining
yet another raiding company.
a|They now spends a|their days raiding innocent villages and raping its villagers,
while a|their nights are spend drinking and getting drunk with a|their new friends.
