<p>
With enough money to retire comfortably, <<rep $g.a>> did just that, and bought
a home in one of the nearby villages around your fort.
a|They does not just spend a|their entire time snoozing around and using
a|their own slaves, however, and a|they would occasionally
<<if $g.a.isHasTrait('muscle_verystrong')>>
show off a|their massive musculature
<<elseif $g.a.isHasTrait('muscle_strong')>>
show off a|their considerable musculature
<<elseif $g.a.isHasTrait('per_direct')>>
do honest work
<<elseif $g.a.isHasTrait('per_slow')>>
be goaded into doing honest work
<<else>>
ward off boredom
<</if>>
by doing random day labor available in the village.
When a trading ship arrive, they would offer a|their help to lug off the many
crates off the ship.
When it is draught season, they would travel far to carry buckets and buckets of water into the village.
While most people do it for the money, a|they just do it for fun now.
