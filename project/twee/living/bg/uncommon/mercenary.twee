:: LIVING_mercenary [nobr]

<p>
Despite already having enough money to simply retire, <<rep $g.a>> grew too restless
and decided to
<<if $g.a.isHasTrait('bg_mercenary')>>
once again
<<else>>
try a|their a|hands at something new and
<</if>>
take up being a mercenary job.
a|They would spend
<<if $g.a.isHasTrait('per_frugal')>>
days haggling the rewards before taking up any quest, making sure to squeeze every potential
coin out of the contract.
<<else>>
hours haggling the rewards for any quest a|they take.
<</if>>
<<if !$g.a.isHasTrait('per_kind')>>
a|Their services would grow quite famous, especially when it comes to recapturing slaves.
<</if>>
Occasionally, some quests would bring a|them over to the fort, either to seek help
or to resupply.
