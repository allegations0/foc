After making sure a|their money are stored safely in the <<rep $company.bank>>'s vaults,
<<rep $g.a>> retreated back into the wilderness of
<<uhomeland $g.a>>
<<if $g.a.isHasTrait('bg_wildman')>>
The wild<<man $g.a>> resumes a|their old lifestyle, and seems perfectly content with it.
<<else>>
The loner a|race has always felt uncomfortable near other people, and living as a recluse seems
like a perfect fit for a|them.
