:: LIVING_demon [nobr]

<p>
After spending all a|their money buying the rarest slaves 
<<lore continent_main>> has to offer,
<<rep $g.a>> vanished completely from the mortal plane.
It is rumored that the demon had returned back to a|their home,
far beyond <<lore concept_mist>>, taking all these poor slaves
for god-knows what purpose.
Still, a|they would occasionally be seen back in the mortal plane,
being one of the few demons with the luxury of being able to go
and away to this plane as a|they please.
