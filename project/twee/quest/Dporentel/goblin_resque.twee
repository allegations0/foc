:: Quest_goblin_resque2 [nobr]

<p>
As a slaving company, your company does not usually get contracted for rescue missions.
But rescuing people from the so-called <<lore race_goblin>> dens is a different deal.
You see, these green squats are widely known to capture any women
that are unfortunate enough to wander into their territory.
The girls are used for breeding until they are no longer functional,
as these distant relatives of the orc race themselves are almost always lacking in females.
</p>

<p>
It seems some goblins are migrating right about now, and many groups
formed (temporary?) dens in areas uncomfortably close to the city recently.
You could try to send an extermination squad to clear out
a couple of these dens under the guise of trying to rid the world of greater evil.
You are sure to encounter some girls inside â€”- Your company can certainly
put them under new management
without telling the cityfolks anything.
Truly a win-win situation.
</p>

<p>
The cave den your slavers cleared out seemed abandoned at first,
but still-armed traps inside told a different story.
The den appeared to be a decoy that was made to hide the actual den where all the good stuffs
were located.
Fortunately,
<<reps $g.spotter>> attention to detail allowed the group to
eventually find a secret tunnel, which led them to the actual den.
</p>

<p>
The fight inside was fierce.
Narrow corridors combined with an overwhelming amount of opponents tested the limits of
<<reps $g.fighter>> combat skills.

<<if $g.fighter.isHasTrait('skill_ambidextrous')>>
  Fortunately, <<they $g.fighter>> fighter|is ambidextrous, and fighter|was able to freely switch
  between left and right <<uhand $g.fighter>> for wielding <<their $g.fighter>> <<uweapon $g.fighter>>.
<</if>>

<<if $g.fighter.isHasTrait('tough_nimble')>>
  <<They $g.fighter>> fighter|is sufficiently nimble and could still move with ease in the small space.
<</if>>

Eventually, <<they $g.fighter>> managed to <<uadv $g.fighter>>
vanquish all these green rodents.
</p>

<p>
The captured girls are located in the final, innermost chamber of the den:
the ominously-named breeding chamber.
It was a large room with female bodies lining the walls,
most already too broken to be profitable to capture<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>,
with the exception of one that seemed quite alright<</if>>. The
<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>only other<<elseif $gOutcome == 'success' || $gOutcome == 'failure'>>only<</if>>
girl whose condition seemed fixable was strapped to a large (at least for a goblin)
brute. The girl was seemingly being used as an armor for the brute sitting on something resembling a
throne in the center of the chamber.
The threat of needlessly hurting the merchandise made this fight significantly
harder than it should've been,
<<if $gOutcome == 'crit' || $gOutcome == 'success'>>but the team managed to prevail and
defeated the brute without inflicting any heavy damage to the girl.
<<elseif $gOutcome == 'failure'>>
and unfortunately several stray hits met the "armor" girl, ultimately defeating both
the brute and rendering the girl useless.
<</if>>
<<if $gOutcome == 'crit' || $gOutcome == 'success'>>
With the fight over, the team surveyed the battlescene. All in all,
they remained unscathed, surely no small thanks to <<reps $g.healer>> hard work.
Their prize amounts to
<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>two girls: <<rep $g.toy1>> and <<rep $g.toy2>><<elseif $gOutcome == 'success'>>one girl: <<rep $g.toy1>><</if>>.
The girl<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>s<</if>> will surely need a lot of time to recover from their ordeal
before you can put them to better use.
<<elseif $gOutcome == 'failure'>>
But the victory did not come free.
The group suffered some injuries during the fight, and even worse, they
weren't able to bring back any usable merchandise.
Still though, they vanquished a den of evil, and saved many, many girls from terrible fate
of being anchored and used as goblin's breeding bitches.
Surely such a good deed warmed your slavers' hearts?
Not to mention the grateful female citizens that will hopefully spread the good word about your company.
<</if>>

:: Quest_goblin_resque2Disaster [nobr]
<p>
Your slavers were greeted with a giant fireball right to the face when they tried to enter the cave.
It turned out that goblins can wield magic too, and with terrifying efficiency.
They did manage to run away as soon as they understood the dangers,
but the damn big fireball seriously wounded your slavers in the process.
If not for <<reps $g.healer>> medical talents, they'd all be steak by now.
</p>
