        Moonlight filters through the windows of the <<rep setup.buildingtemplate.alchemistshop>>. You've more or less lived there for the past...month? More? Groggily you lift your head from the table and stretch, your neck clicking as you realise the room has gone dark. You must have fallen asleep again. Rubbing your eyes you fumble for the cup of tea beside you. Stone cold. Turning to the glow of the fire you see the fireplace has burned down to cold ash. The glow is... your gaze travels left back to the glass vessel, glowing a reddish orange from the liquid inside.

            finally

        done. Stumbling over to the beaker you reach out with trembling hands and then pause. You slip your hands into the heat resistant mittens and then lift the beaker off its trivet, and carefully pour it into the sterilised bottle already packed into straw. The fumes smell like vaguely of pineapple and semen and you feel

    "It's done," <<they $g.alchemist>> says, holding the box out to you.<br>

        "Have you tested it?" You ask, looking up from your chair.<br>
    <</if>>
    <<name $g.alchemist>> looks at you, pauses, and then looks down at the glowing bottle. "The fumes work well enough," <<they $g.alchemist>> says, shifting uncomfortably. "If you're asking about permanent effect, we won't know until you hand it to someone to drink."<br>
    <<if $unit.player.isHasTrait('per_chaste')>>
        Hesitantly, you unstopper the bottle, and the smell of the potion makes you recoil, jamming the cork back in and trying to refrain from retching. Maybe it works better on people who aren't you.
    <<else>>
        Crooking a finger to the closest slave, you unstopper the bottle and hold the cork out to <<them $g.slave>>. "Lick," you say with a grin.<br>

Smiling you <<ustrippantsand $unit.player>> spread your legs, giving <<name $g.slave>> access as <<they $g.slave>> get to work, <<their $g.slave>> eyes and tongue begging you to fuck them, do anything to them, as long as they get some release. Leaning back you smile at <<name $g.alchemist>>.<br>
        "Well done," you say as you grip the back of <<name $g.slave>>'s head and encourage them to work harder. "I think this is going to be great...<br>

        Moonlight filters through the windows of the <<rep setup.buildingtemplate.alchemistshop>>. You've more or less lived there for the past...month? More? Groggily you lift your head from the table and stretch, your neck clicking as you realise the room has gone dark. You must have fallen asleep again. Rubbing your eyes you fumble for the cup of tea beside you. Stone cold. Turning to the glow of the fire you see the fireplace has burned down to embers. Shit. Jumping to your feet you rush to the beaker and see a dull yellow liquid with a silvery sediment at the bottom. Wafting the fumes towards you leaves you completely unmoved, and you consider trying a sip before remembering you have a dungeon full of test subjects. Fetching one of them in you tilt <<their $g.slave>> head back and tap <<their $g.slave>> chin so that <<they $g.slave>> opens up.<br>
        "Good <<girl $g.slave>>," you say. "Now swallow."
    </p>
    <p>
        The results are...underwhelming to say the least, but you've come up with a very pleasant drink that sparkles in the light and tastes vaguely of effervescent pineapple. In the end you flog it to the merchants of Lucgate. It's definitely a mild aphrodisiac, just temporary and doesn't make the drinker more inclined to do anything they weren't already wanting to do. Maybe you'll have better luck next time.
    </p>

<<else>>
    It is around noon when <<name $g.alchemist>> stumbles into the <<rep setup.buildingtemplate.greathall>>, feet dragging and clutching a small wooden box with a couple of ceramic bottles nestled inside, padded with hay from the stables. <<Their $g.alchemist>> hair is wild and unkempt, <<their $g.alchemist>> clothes rumpled and there are dark bags under <<their $g.alchemist>> eyes.<br>
    "It didn't work, <<unickname $g.alchemist>>," <<they $g.alchemist>> says glumly.<br>
    "No result at all?"<br>
    "Oh it's a perfectly drinkable and very tasty drink and it'll give you a naughty buzz, but nothing like what we wanted," <<they $g.alchemist>> says, running a finger through <<their $g.alchemist>> hair. "I thought about distilling it, but the effects just aren't strong enough. Maybe the fruit was too old given how long it took to get back here, or maybe I got the quantities wrong—"<br>
    You hold up one hand to interrupt. "Very tasty? You drank it?"<br>
    <<name $g.alchemist>> shrugs. "I gave some to a slave first and nothing happened, so yes. Taste's a bit like effervescent pineapple with a bit of a kick to it. Great with mint."<br>
    "Okay," you say thoughtfully ."Flog it to the nobles of Lucgate. Pitch it right and they'll eat it up, especially if it gets their absolutely not-slaves to crave some dick, even if it's just for right then."<br>
    <p>
        It's not the effect you wanted, but at least you'll recoup some of your costs. Maybe you'll have better luck next time.

        The think smoke grey-blue smoke that filled the laboratory and sent you stumbling out the door in search of fresh air was not supposed to happen, and when the cauldron finally stops bubbling and you make it back in, you see the potion has become a thick, mucky goop that smells terrible and tastes worse. The smell lingers in your nostrils for days and turns you completely off sex. Ah well, back to the drawing board.

    Almost a month after <<name $g.alchemist>> all but locked <<themselves $g.alchemist>> away in the <<rep setup.buildingtemplate.alchemistshop>>, shouts, coughing, and a blue-grey cloud of smoky vapour has you legging it towards the shop, finding <<name $g.alchemist>> doubled over outside, coughing. <<Their $g.alchemist>> hair is wild and unkempt, <<their $g.alchemist>> clothes rumpled <<they $g.alchemist>> looks defeated.<br>
    "I don't think that worked, <<unickname $g.alchemist>>," <<they $g.alchemist>> says.<br>
    When the smoke clears enough for you to venture inside, you find what remains of the potion has become a thick, mucky goop at the bottom of the cauldron. It also has a near opposite, if temporary effect to the one you were hoping for, and tastes so foul that even your most obedient slaves end up throwing it back up again in a matter of minutes. Sighing, you chalk it up as a lost cause. Maybe you'll do better next time.

        When you finally regain your senses, you find yourself in the dungeons, amongst a slumbering mound of cum soaked flesh. Looking around, you see the nude forms of both slaves and slavers. It looks like you took on all comers in every orifice you have. Licking your cracked lips you find the inside of your mouth still coated in the sticky residue of semen, and you are barely able to stand for the pain in your lower body. Limping out of the dungeons you back to your bedroom and fall into your bed, alone and fucked out. You suspect you're going to need a while to recover before you can even think about trying to figure out what you did wrong.

Then there was smoke and I... really need cock."<br>
                    Slipping your hands under his shoulders you start to thrust into his ass. "Well I'm here to give it to you," you gasp as he tightens around you, working your cock with his ass muscles and pushing back to meet each of your thrusts, desperate to cram every inch of you into him.<br>

                    His hands are everywhere, gliding up your back and gripping your shoulders hard enough to leave bruises as he clenches around you, his mouth seeking yours as you tense and start to unload deep into him.<br>
                    "Oh fuck yes," he moans, his voice breathy in your ear.<br>
                    "what about you? you didn't—"<br>
