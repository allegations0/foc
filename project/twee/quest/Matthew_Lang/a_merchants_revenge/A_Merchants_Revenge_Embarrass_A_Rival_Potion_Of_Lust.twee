<p>
    After a lot of time and effort, <<name $g.merchant>> has uncovered the identity of <<their $g.merchant>> rival behind the attacks on <<their $g.merchant>> caravans, and has found a window of opportunity to strike back—and has asked to enlist your aid in doing so.
</p>
<p>
    You have decided to use a <<rep setup.item.potion_lust>> to enact that revenge.
</p>
<p>
    <<name $g.merchant>> has pointed you to a wealthy, guarded compound in the cloud district of Lucgate.
    <<dialogue $g.merchant>>
        <<name $g.target>> will be alone with only a light guard presence due to...reasons. <<They $g.target>> is our primary target's _role and have a penchant for high class prostitutes.
    <</dialogue>>
    <<name $g.merchant>> has intercepted <<name $g.target>>'s most recent 'order' from <<their $g.target>> favourite brothel, and you have the opportunity to send a slaver at the appointed day and time instead. They'd then need to slip the lust potion into something for <<name $g.target>> to drink. After that, it should be a simple enough matter to let the rest of the team into the manor to enact the rest of the plan. As long as they can avoid detection by the guards still on the grounds.
</p>
<p>
    This is a rare opportunity, and it may be a while before another one presents itself. Of course, if you or your slavers are identified, you will raise the ire of the Merchants of Tor. Best not be identified if at all possible.

            Walking up the path between the leering guards dressed in suggestive, yet tasteful clothing was
            <<if $unit.player.isHasTrait('per_chaste')>>
                enough to make your skin crawl,
            <<elseif $unit.player.isHasTrait('per_sexaddict')>>
                really too conservative for your tastes,
            <<else>>
                slightly chilly in the cool night air,
            <</if>>
            but it did the trick, and you soon found yourself having an extravagant but light meal while <<name $g.target>> spoke, in great detail, of the very kinky things <<they $g.target>> wanted to do to your body. In a sense it's a shame you needed to drug <<them $g.target>> as <<they $g.target>> otherwise would make an excellent client
            <<if $fort.player.isHasBuilding("recreationwing")>>
                , at least for your entertainment areas if not for a slave.
            <<else>>
                , assuming <<they $g.target>> had a place to keep a slave or two.
            <</if>>
            Still, once you took to feeding <<them $g.target>> sensuously it was a simple matter to slip the Potion of Lust into <<their $g.target>> wine while you bent over in front of <<them $g.target>>, giving <<them $g.target>> an eyeful—and handful—of rump.
        </p>
        <p>
            It didn't take long for the potion to take effect. <<name $g.target>>'s cheeks flushed, and you saw beads of sweat break out on <<their $g.target>> forehead.<br>
            "It's uh, really warm in here," <<they $g.target>> says, tugging at <<their $g.target>> top.<br>
            <<if $unit.player.isHasTrait('per_chaste')>>
                "Oh, um, is it? Well, I—"<br>
            <<elseif $unit.player.isHasTrait('per_sexaddict')>>
                "Maybe you should take off your clothes," you say with a wink, striding over towards the glass doors to the courtyard garden so that the moonlight backlit your silhouette as you
                <<if $unit.player.isHasTrait('gender_male')>>
                    pulled off your shirt, and ran your hands down over your chest and down to the bulge in your trousers.
                <<else>>
                    slipped the straps of your dress off your shoulders and let the silky fabric fall to the ground.
                <</if>>
            <<else>>
                "And we're just getting started," you say with a grin, striding over to the glass doors leading out to the courtyard garden, reaching up to remove your
                <<if $unit.player.isHasTrait('gender_male')>>
                    shirt.
                <<else>>
                    dress.
                <</if>>
            <</if>>

            <<They $g.target>> were on you faster than you thought possible, kissing your desperately, pawing at your
            <<if $unit.player.isHasTrait('gender_male')>>
                chest,
            <<else>>
                breasts,
            <</if>>
            needy whimpers coming from <<their $g.target>> throat as the lust potion took effect. Distracting them with your lips and body, you were able to flick the latch on the door before pushing <<name $g.target>> back towards the couch and climbing on top of <<them $g.target>>.<br>
            "Is

                undid your trousers and smacked <<their $g.target>> face with your cock.<br>
                "Don't tease me," <<they $g.target>> whined, and you obliged, shoving in until
                <<if $unit.player.isHasTrait('race_wolfkin')>>
                    <<their $g.target>> nose was buried in your fur.

                <<elseif $unit.player.isHasTrait('race_lizardkin')>>
                    <<their $g.target>> nose was pushed up against your scales.

                <</if>>
            <<else>>
                <<their $g.target>> mouth was pressed up against your pussy.
            <</if>>
            <br>
            Grabbing <<their $g.target>> wrists you pin them behind <<their $g.target>> head and then slip on the padded cuffs.<br>
            <<if $unit.player.isHasTrait('per_chaste')>>
                "Um, j-just your mouth, no hands, got it?" You grit your teeth and turn your head away as <<they $g.target>> moans <<their $g.target>> assent.<br>
            <<elseif $unit.player.isHasTrait('per_sexaddict')>>
                "Show me what you can do with your mouth babe. And no playing with yourself, got it?" Throwing your head back you sigh in contentment as <<their $g.target>> mouth worships your
                <<if $g.target.isHasTrait('gender_male')>>
                    cock.
                <<else>>

            <<if $unit.player.isHasTrait('per_chaste')>>
                You stayed in place as long as you needed to, distracting <<name $g.target>> and blocking <<their $g.target>> view while <<rep _o1>> and <<rep _o2>> entered in quietly through the unlocked door. By the time they were both in, <<name $g.target>> was a moaning mess, eager for any sexual contact <<they $g.target>> could get, and you were all too happy to let your slavers take over, and the two of them kept <<name $g.target>> extremely happy.

                You probably spent longer than you should filling all of <<their $g.target>> holes over and over until your

            left the same way you entered, out past the guards and with

                nowhere near enough gold for that experience in a pouch at your belt.
            <<elseif $unit.player.isHasTrait('per_sexaddict')>>

            When <<rep _o1>> and <<rep _o2>> arrived back at the fort, they nodded. Everything was in place. When word reached you later of the outrage when a powerful merchant's lunch party was derailed by the discovery of the merchant's _role, spread out on the dining table, hands bound behind <<their $g.target>> back, begging to be fucked more, harder, and with a giant dildo shoved up <<their $g.target>> <<uhole $g.target>>.

It was easy enough to sneak over the wall. Then it was just a matter of staying out of sight while <<name $g.escort>> flirted with <<name $g.target>> and slipped the lust potion into <<their $g.target>> wine.

            <<name $g.merchant>> proved to be correct and the house was even empty of staff. When you finally made it to the main room, you found <<name $g.escort>> had cuffed <<name $g.target>>'s hands behind <<their $g.target>> head and was

When word reached you later of the outrage when a powerful merchant's lunch party was derailed by the discovery of the merchant's _role, spread out on the dining table, hands bound behind <<their $g.target>> back, begging to be fucked more, harder, and with a giant dildo shoved up <<their $g.target>> <<uhole $g.target>>.

A few days later, a large package came to the fort, along with a note.

<div class='lettercard'>
    <p>
        Dear <<name $unit.player>>,
    </p>
    <p>
        Your strike was masterful. I saw everything first hand, as of course, in polite society, one must gloat over one's rivals in public. Please find an artist's commemoration of the fruits of your labor. It's amazing how they've spread so quickly throughout the city. I suppose it's just lucky for <<name $g.artist>> that I'd invited <<them $g.artist>> to the luncheon.
        <<if setup.qres.VarEqual("mlangmerchantprinceflirt", "1").isOk($gQuest)>>
            Maybe you can accompany me to another event in the future if you're interested.
        <<else>>
        <</if>>

    </p>
    <p>
        With thanks and appreciation.

    Dressed in expensive but suggestive clothing, <<rep $g.escort>> walked nervously toward the gated compound.<br>
    "Hey, where do you think you're going, slut?" the guard on the right asked, leering at <<them $g.escort>><br>
    "Uh, I'm here to see <<name $g.target>>. <<They $g.target>>'s expecting me."<br>
    The guards eyed <<rep $g.escort>> up and down carefully. "<<<<They $g.target>>'s expecting a

        big breasted whore, not you pretty boy.
    <<else>>
        big dicked stud, not you little girl.
    <</if>>
    So why don't you come over her and spread your legs for me and my mate here?"<br>
    The guards grabbed <<rep $g.escort>>, but <<rep $g.slaver>> came to <<their $g.escort>> defense and the team legged it from the manse. Unfortunately, the bottle containing the potion of lust shattered in the scuffle, but at least everyone escaped without injury.

            Walking up the path between the leering guards dressed in suggestive, yet tasteful clothing was
            <<if $unit.player.isHasTrait('per_chaste')>>
                enough to make your skin crawl,
            <<elseif $unit.player.isHasTrait('per_sexaddict')>>
                really too conservative for your tastes,
            <<else>>
                slightly chilly in the cool night air,
            <</if>>
            but it did the trick, and you soon found yourself having an extravagant but light meal while <<name $g.target>> spoke, in great detail, of the very kinky things <<they $g.target>> wanted to do to your body. In a sense it's a shame you needed to drug <<them $g.target>> as <<they $g.target>> otherwise would make an excellent client
            <<if $fort.player.isHasBuilding("recreationwing")>>
                , at least for your entertainment areas if not for a slave.

            <</if>>
            Still, once you took to feeding <<them $g.target>> sensuously it was a simple matter to slip the Potion of Lust into <<their $g.target>> wine while you bent over in front of <<them $g.target>>, giving <<them $g.target>> an eyeful—and handful—of rump.
        </p>
        <p>
            It didn't take long for the potion to take effect. <<name $g.target>>'s cheeks flushed, and you saw beads of sweat break out on <<their $g.target>> forehead.<br>
            "It's uh, really warm in here," <<they $g.target>> says, tugging at <<their $g.target>> top.<br>

                    pulled off your shirt, and ran your hands down over your chest and down to the bulge in your trousers.
                <<else>>
                    slipped the straps of your dress off your shoulders and let the silky fabric fall to the ground.

                "And we're just getting started," you say with a grin, striding over to the glass doors leading out to the courtyard garden, reaching up to remove your

            <<They $g.target>> were on you faster than you thought possible, kissing your desperately, pawing at your

                <<their $g.target>> mouth was pressed up against your pussy.

            <br>
            Grabbing <<their $g.target>> wrists you pin them behind <<their $g.target>> head and then slip on the padded cuffs.<br>
            <<if $unit.player.isHasTrait('per_chaste')>>

                "Show me what you can do with your mouth babe. And no playing with yourself, got it?" Throwing your head back you sigh in contentment as <<their $g.target>> mouth worships your

                    cock.
