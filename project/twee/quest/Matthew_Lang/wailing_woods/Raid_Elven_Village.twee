<<questimage 'elf_raid.jpg'>>

<p>
It's come to your attention that a new village of elves has been founded at the edge of the <<lore region_forest>>. You're not entirely certain if this is a settlement with ties to the <<rep $company.elf>>, but they don't appear to have much in the way of guards. This could be an opportunity for you to nab yourself a slave or two.</p>
<p>On the other hand you could leave them alone and see if there's interest in trading or something, but where's the fun in that?</p>

	<p>
	Led by you, your slavers descended upon the village in the dead of night.
		<<if $g.raider1.isHasTrait('per_attentive')>>
		The careful planning <<name $g.raider1>> did beforehand meant your slavers quickly sent the villagers fleeing in a panic, allowing them to help themselves to most of the valuables in the village.

		While some of the residents put up a fight, most fled in fear, allowing <<name $g.raider1>> to ransack many of the houses.

<<set _diplomat = setup.getAnySlaver()>>
<p>
Unfortunately your slavers arrived too late. By the time they reached the village, there were defensive walls, and well armed guards on patrol. Deciding discretion was the better part of valor, your slavers returned to the fort.
</p>
<p>
Later you send <<name _diplomat>> to establish contact with the village. Might as well see if you can wrangle some favour from the <<rep $company.elf>>. Even if you'd rather have a new slave.

:: Quest_raid_elven_villageDisaster [nobr]
<p>
Unfortunately your slavers arrived too late. By the time they reached the village, there were defensive walls, and well armed guards on patrol. Deciding they had come too far to turn back, <<name $g.raider1>> led the assault, only for your slavers to be soundly thrashed. Even after the decision had been made to retreat, the elves pursued to the edge of the forest, peppering your slavers with arrows—and causing wounds that are going to take some time to heal.
