    <p>
        Dear <<name $unit.player>>,
    </p>
    <p>
        I have been made aware of a caravan carrying a shipment of
        <<if $gQuest.getSeed() % 6 == 0>>
            <<set _goods = "marble">>
        <<elseif $gQuest.getSeed() % 6 == 1>>
            <<set _goods = "wheat">>
        <<elseif $gQuest.getSeed() % 6 == 2>>
            <<set _goods = "apples">>
        <<elseif $gQuest.getSeed() % 6 == 3>>
            <<set _goods = "ale">>
        <<elseif $gQuest.getSeed() % 6 == 4>>
            <<set _goods = "linen">>
        <<elseif $gQuest.getSeed() % 6 == 5>>
            <<set _goods = "iron ingots">>
        <</if>>
        <<= _goods>>
        is due to arrive at Lucgate very shortly. The matter is of urgency as the caravan originates inside the Kingdom. The usual bonus will apply if you can prevent it from reaching the city.
    </p>
</div>

<p>
    Turning the note over, you see a hastily sketched map showing
    <<if $gQuest.getSeed() % 5 == 0>>
        a shallow ford over the <<lore geo_cerna>>.
        <<set _location = "river">>
    <<elseif $gQuest.getSeed() % 5 == 1>>
        a cobbled road leading north past large swathes of farmland.
        <<set _location = "farmland">>
    <<elseif $gQuest.getSeed() % 5 == 2>>
        a rocky outcrop in the foothills of the western mountains.
        <<set _location = "foothills">>
    <<elseif $gQuest.getSeed() % 5 == 3>>
        a rocky beach along the southern coastline.
        <<set _location = "beach">>
    <<elseif $gQuest.getSeed() % 5 == 4>>
        a lakeside trail in the western marches.
        <<set _location = "lake">>
    <</if>>
    While it looks possible to stage an ambush there, but the area is more heavily populated than you'd normally like. The chances of being seen are...a lot higher.

    <<if _location == "river">>
        a shallow section of the <<lore geo_cerna>>, not too far from your fort, and a favoured crossing point for travellers. The issue wasn't going to be ambushing the caravanâ€”the issue was going to be getting away unseen.

        <<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
            <p>
                It was sundown when the caravan made it to the river, and rather than pitch a camp, most of them took rooms in the Inn at the far side of the road - leaving only a token guard outside. At that point your slavers moved back from their vantage points to rest until the dark of night.
                <<if $unit.player.isHasAnyTraitExact(["per_lunatic", "per_evil"])>>
                    Attacking the inn was always an option. Or burning it. After all, they set up business close to your fort, they knew the risks. Still, you had to be quiet. After all, you

                <<else>>
                    You normally didn't bother the inn. It was a simple matter of not shitting where you ate. Still, killing them all meant... except, you didn't have to kill them. You
                <</if>>
                just needed the goods. And the ford with its rough water was right there.
            </p>


            With the clouds covering the moon, you led your slavers around the back of the inn, easily subduing the single guard hiding inside the doorway in an attempt to keep warm.

            <<if _goods == "ale">>
                Once inside you quickly smashed open the barrels of ale and headed back to the ford.
            <<elseif _goods == "marble">>
                <p>
                    It was unclear if the marble slabs were going to be continuing on road on drays, or floated down the river on barges.
                    <<set _unit = setup.selectUnit([$g.scout, $g.fighter, $g.raider], {trait: 'magic_earth'})>>
                    <<if _unit>>
                        But the conundrum was solved when <<name _unit>> used their familiarity with earth magic to turn the marble into mud, which filled the bottom of the drays with a thick layer of sludge.<br>
                        "Well, that was easy," <<name _unit>> said <<uadv _unit>>. "Shall we go?"

                    <<else>>

                        <<set _unit = setup.selectUnit([$g.scout, $g.fighter, $g.raider], {trait: 'magic_earth_master'})>>
                        <<if _unit>>
                            But the conundrum was solved when <<name _unit>> used their mastery of earth magic to turn the marble into sand, which immediately started to fall through the cracks of the drays to the floor.<br>
                            "Well, that was easy," <<name _unit>> said <<uadv _unit>>. "Shall we go?"
                        <<else>>
                            There were barges though, and your slavers toiled for several hours to load them with the marble slabs, smash a hole in the side and set them adrift in the current. Hopefully by the time they sank they'd be stuck in rocks, or in deep, murky water.
                        <</if>>
                    <</if>>
                </p>
            <<elseif _goods == "wheat" or _goods == "apples">>
                <p>
                    It was a simple enough matter to tip the _goods into the river, and you were able to call it a job well done.
                </p>
            <<elseif _goods == "linen">>
                <p>
                    After securing a few bolts for
                    <<if $fort.player.isHasBuilding("workshop")>>
                        your tailor,

                        yourself,
                    <</if>>
                    you, <<name _o1>> and <<name _o2>> took your knives and started cutting and stabbing into the remaining fabric. It wouldn't make it completely unsellable, but much of it would be useless for anything except rags.
                </p>
            <<else>>
                <p>
                    The heavy load of iron ingots was a problem. They were heavy and they were difficult to break.
                    <<set _unit = setup.selectUnit([$g.fighter, $g.raider, $g.scout], {trait: 'magic_fire'})>>
                    <<if _unit>>
                        After a moment, <<name _unit>> shrugged.<br>
                        "Get ready to run back over the ford," <<they _unit>> said and then used <<their _unit>> fire magic to melt the ingots, turning them into a rapidly cooling mass that started both dripping through and burning the drays they were in, filling the stables with smoke. It wouldn't take long for the alarm to be raised.

                    <<else>>

                        <<set _unit = setup.selectUnit([$g.fighter, $g.raider, $g.scout], {trait: 'magic_fire_master'})>>

                Taking up positions inside the treeline, your slavers waited for the smugglers to arrive.

                Your slavers fell upon the smugglers like a pack of hungry wolves and soon had them all defeated. Looking up <<name $g.scout>> saw the schooner slip out of the bay, and <<they $g.scout>> could only hope the captain either wouldn't recognise them, or wouldn't speak of it. After all, they'd already been paid for their services, and hopefully handsomely enough to replace two longboats.

                Taking up positions inside the treeline, you waited for the smugglers to arrive. First a small, tattered schooner rowed into the bay, the wooden hull slipping into view through the mist. They paused for a while, almost as if waiting, and <<name $g.scout>> could see there was a hurried conversation happening on the deck of the ship. Then, they reversed course and rowed their way back out into open water, leaving your slavers cursing their luck. <<name $g.scout>> didn't think they'd been seen, but clearly something had spooked them.

                Taking up positions inside the treeline, your slavers waited for the smugglers to arrive. Unfortunately, the first thing to arrive were a pair of large crocodiles, who rushed up from the estuary and attacked <<name $g.fighter>>, probably in search of an easy meal. Caught by surprise, your slavers fought valiantly to extricate themselves from the fight, and while the injuries they sustained weren't major, they all developed a fever and the wounds swelled painfully, probably something from the bite of those carrion eaters.
            </p>
            <p>
                They never saw the smugglers, and after the crocodiles, they didn't feel like waiting around for them any longer

        a shores of a placid blue lake out in the western marches. It seemed strange to <<name $g.scout>> that such an idyllic place had not been settled, but it was very far from the cityâ€”and it was close enough to the <<lore region_forest>> that anyone settling here risked being raided - or enslaved - by the elves. Or even the catkin.

        <<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
            <p>
                After a brief investigation, <<name $g.scout>>discovered the lake was fairly deep, and dropped away quickly from the shore. With that knowledge your slavers set up an ambush with the track between them and the lake, and waited for the caravan to arrive. When it did, your slavers pushed them hard, and <<name $g.raider>> went straight for the horses, scaring them into the waters of the lake where they foundered and sunk, dragging the wagons in with them. Suddenly, your slavers saw slimy green tentacles wrench the horses under water, returning moments afterward to pull under those traders who had fallen into the water along with the wagons. Although momentarily taken aback, <<name $g.scout>> and <<name $g.fighter>> focused on forcing the guards back into the water and into the slimy embrace of whatever monster lived in the depths of the lake.

            <p>
                In the end, all that was left were floating wooden remnants of the trade wagons, and one caravanner who had surrendered rather than face a watery death. The surface of the lake bubbled and roiled for a while before going completely still once more, only the flotsam and the red clouds of blood testament to the violence that had just transpired.

                After a brief investigation, <<name $g.fighter>> discovered the lake was fairly deep, and dropped away quickly from the shore. <<They $g.fighter>> also discovered the reason the lake hadn't been colonised when a large, green, slimy tentacle tried to wrap around <<their $g.fighter>> leg. Jumping out of the water, your slavers backed away from the water's edge, and spied the caravan on the far side of the lake, the guards obviously having seen them. With the element of surprise lost and definitely outnumbered, <<name $g.scout>> gave them a wave and turned to head back to the fort. They'd get the next caravan. This one was going to be far too much trouble.

                Unfortunately, the caravan was well guarded, and one of them turned out to be highly proficient in water magic, creating a waterspout that picked <<name $g.raider>> up and dropped them into the middle of the lake. Soon, <<name $g.fighter>> and <<name $g.scout>> joined <<them $g.raider>> in the water, and the caravan continued on, moving out of their reach long before they reached the shore. Cursing their bad luck your slavers headed back to the fort, hoping that they hadn't broken any bones over the course of that fightâ€”and fall.
