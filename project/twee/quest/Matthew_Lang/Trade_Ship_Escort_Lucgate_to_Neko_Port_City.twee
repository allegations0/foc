        It's a week's voyage to Neko Port City. Two if you're coming back with us.
    <<elseif $gQuest.getSeed() % 3 == 1>>
        You looking for work? I got a cargo hold full of _goods I need to get to Neko Port City. Gotta love the elven hostilities.
    <<elseif $gQuest.getSeed() % 3 == 2>>
        Yeah, I know who you are. Fancy some honest work for a change? Or should I be calling the guard?
    <</if>>
<</dialogue>>

<p>
    With trade between the Wood Elves and the Torans being minimal and the border an ongoing series of skirmishes, much of the trade with the Neko is done by sea. Of course, even hugging the coastline, the usual perils of sea travel still threaten. Pirates, kraken, the siren song of the merfolk and more mundane dangers like reefs and storms can all sink a ship, but at least some of that can be offset by hiring additional guards. Preferably those who can rig sail and swim. Captain <<name $g.captain>> is one such trader looking to hire additional guards. It's not normally a job for slavers, but it could also be easy money if nothing of note happens on the voyage.

    The voyage started out with fresh winds and sunshine as _ship cut through the coastal waters along the southern coast of <<lore continent_main>>. <<Rep $g.lookout>> climbed up the rigging to the crow's nest, enjoying the view as the coast slipped along the starboard side of the ship, while <<rep $g.sailor>> pitched in with the crew,

It was barely even a fight, and you slaughtered the boarding party to a man. The pirate ship broke off and fled, leaving you to pick over the bodies. Unfortunately, the down on their luck pirates didn't have much of worth - but you did find a very nice rapier, which more than makes up for the lack of treasure—or slaves.

        The pirate ship that attacked _ship was larger—much larger— and your slavers were hopelessly outmatched. Thankfully the pirates were more interested in plunder than captives, and left you alone after taking everything of value on board—including the _goods in the cargo hold. _ship limped back to port, and

    <p>
        The pirate ship that attacked _ship was larger—much larger— and your slavers were hopelessly outmatched. It didn't even come to an actual melee, with _ship breaking apart in rough seas as it was rammed repeatedly by the pirate ship. Most of the crew washed up on sore, but as your slavers took stock and counted heads, one of them hadn't made it.
