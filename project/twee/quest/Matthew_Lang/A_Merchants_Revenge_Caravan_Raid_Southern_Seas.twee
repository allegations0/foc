    <<if _location == "achipelago">>
        a small chain of islands, all of them small enough to sail around in a few hours.

        <<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
            <<set _unit = setup.selectUnit([$g.scout, $g.fighter, $g.raider], {anytrait: ['bg_pirate', 'bg_seaman']})>>

                <<Rep _unit>> suggested hiding around the back of one of the larger islands, and either sail out to intercept, or see if _ship's crew come ashore for water.
            <<else>>
                Your ship's captain suggested hiding around the back of one of the larger islands, and either sail out to intercept, or see if _ship's crew come ashore for water.
            <</if>>

            <p>
                Fortunately, hiding your ship worked, and <<rep $g.scout>> soon spied _ship from the crows nest, taking the expected route past the islands, and riding low in the water with an obviously full cargo. It looked like they might have been carrying much more than just the _goods your slavers needed to intercept. As your ship swung out on an interception route, <<rep $g.raider>> aimed the ship's ballista at the level of _ship's deck and fired, the large bolt striking one of the crew and taking them off the side.
            </p>
            <p>
                The battle was swift and bloody, but it soon became apparent that your ship outmatched _ship and their captained wished to surrender. Do you:
                <<choose>>
                <<opt "Loot the cargo and let the ship go">>
                    <<run setup.qc.Item('f_tile_normal').apply($gQuest)>>
                    <<run setup.qc.Money(1000).apply($gQuest)>>
                    You took your time picking through the cargo, taking the _goods, the more lucrative trade items and one of the crew as a likely slave. You also secured a rug that might look good somewhere in the fort from a shipment of carpets. With a jaunty wave, you sailed off, leaving _ship's crew to repair their sails and patch their hull.
                <<opt "Loot what you want, and scuttle the ship, leaving whatever crew remains ot fend for themselves">>
                    Your captain was uncomfortable with your decision, and started talking about a 'code of the seas', but you cut him off and set about picking out a few potential slaves before <<rep $g.fighter>> and <<rep $g.raider>> hacked large holes in _ship's hull. Given how shallow the water was, it could probably be raised and salvaged eventually, but you'd guaranteed the ship wouldn't make port. There was a lot of tension on the ship as you make for port, and when you returned to Lucgate the captain was very eager to see the back of you.
