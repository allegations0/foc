    <p>
        Dear <<name $unit.player>>,
    </p>
    <p>
        There is s certain a caravan carrying a shipment of
        <<if $gQuest.getSeed() % 6 == 0>>
            <<set _goods = "myrrh">>
        <<elseif $gQuest.getSeed() % 6 == 1>>

            <<set _goods = "erotic pottery">>
        <<elseif $gQuest.getSeed() % 6 == 5>>
            <<set _goods = "honey ants">>
        <</if>>
        <<= _goods>>
        that I do not want to arrive at Lucgate. If you can intervene in this matter, the usual bonus will apply. You may, of course, loot whatever you wish from the caravan itself.
    </p>
</div>

<p>
    On the back of the note you find a crude map showing
    <<if $gQuest.getSeed() % 5 == 0>>
        an escarpment west of the <<lore geo_cassian>> where a rocky escarpment falls to the desert sands.
        <<set _location = "escarpment">>
    <<elseif $gQuest.getSeed() % 5 == 1>>
        a winding mountain road with a sheer drop on one side.
        <<set _location = "cliff">>
    <<elseif $gQuest.getSeed() % 5 == 2>>
        a rocky outcrop in the eastern foothills of the <<lore geo_cassian>>.
        <<set _location = "foothills">>
    <<elseif $gQuest.getSeed() % 5 == 3>>
        an oasis in the <<lore region_desert>>.
        <<set _location = "oasis">>
    <<elseif $gQuest.getSeed() % 5 == 4>>
        a waystone marker along a well travelled road.
        <<set _location = "road">>
    <</if>>
    It looks possible to stage an ambush there, but the desert is a very dangerous place. You should ensure the slavers you send on this mission are ready for the challenge.

After studying the map carefully,

    <<if _location == "escarpment">>
        a ridgeline where the rock of the escarpment fell away to the desert sands belowâ€”and the only paths up or down were narrow, precarious trails cut into the cliff.

        <<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
            <p>
                Taking advantage of a small copse of mustard trees, your slavers settled in to wait, taking it in turns to peek over the edge too see if your quarry was near.
                <<set _local = setup.selectUnit([$g.scout, $g.fighter, $g.raider], {anytrait: ['subrace_humandesert','subrace_orc']})>>
                <<if _local>>
                    <<name _local>> picked some of the purplish mustard berries and handed them out, providing you all with a small snack.<br>
                    <<set _questioner = setup.selectUnit([$g.scout, $g.fighter, $g.raider], {notrait: ['subrace_humandesert','subrace_orc']})>>

                        "Are these what mustard's made from then?" <<name _questioner>> asked doubtfully.<br>
                        <<name _local>> shook <<their _local>> head. "No, I'd never even had your mustard until I went west.<br>
                    <</if>>
                    It was, if nothing else, nice to have a source of liquid in this head, no matter how tiny.
                <</if>>
                You all snoozed throughout the day and huddled together for warmth during the night, only building a small fire, dug deep into the rocky ground to try to hide its glow. Eventually, <<name _o1>> saw a line of bobbing lights in the distance, coming closer and closer to the cliffs. You watched them over the next several hours and soon the lights turned into dark shadows into barely discernable figures in the starlight. Your targets had arrived.
            </p>
            <p>
                The caravan stopped at the base of the escarpment, but made no attempt to begin the climb the road.
                <<set _unit = setup.selectUnit([$g.scout, $g.fighter, $g.raider], {trait: 'per_aggressive'})>>

                        "Probably dawn," <<name _cautious>> said. "Would you want to lead a train of laden wagons up the side of a sheer cliff at night?" <br>

                <</if>>
                When dawn spilled across the horizon, the soft light lit up the cliffs and shone into your eyes. It also signalled a flurry of activity at the base of the cliff, as the caravan began its slow climb up to the top of the escarpment.

                    You let them get halfway up before <<name _unit>> made the earth of the escarpment tremble and quake, causing many in the caravan to fall and their camels to panic. Too busy trying to maintain their footing, the caravanners were in no position to fight back against your volleys of missiles and those that made it to the top were easily cut down.

                    <p>
                        You let them get almost to the top before <<name _unit>> drew flames from the coals of your firepit and directed them down onto the caravan, even as everyone else started dropping pots of pitch and tar, causing gouts of flame when <<name _unit>>'s magic met the flammable substances.

                        <<if $unit.player.isHasAnyTraitExact(["per_kind", "per_empath"])>>
                            The screams of those set alight seared into your brain and turned your stomach, especially as many chose to jump than stay within range of the magic.
                        <<elseif $unit.player.isHasTrait("per_cruel")>>
                            The screams of the dying and the smell of burnt flesh brought a smile to your lips. You hadn't felt so alive in ages.
                        <<else>>
                            Many chose to jump rather than stay within range of the magic and if you close your eyes you can still hear them, and smell the stomach churning stench of scorched flesh.

Opening the box you were somewhat surprised to see the ant heads turn towards you, but then, of course. The sweet honey they held inside their bloated abdomens would keep them alive during travel. You contemplated eating one, as such a delicacy was typically reserved for the <<rep $company.royal>>, sometimes dipped into the finest chocolate, but decided that could wait until you were clear of the camp.

                    The sacks of hard, dried chickpeas were easy to find, and you, <<name _o1>> and <<name _o2>> spent almost an hour carrying them off into the reeds, slitting them open and letting the legumes fall into the water and the fine silt below. The reeds ensured that even if the caravan was so inclined, sifting the mud to recover the chickpeas would be a fruitless endeavour.

                    The pottery turned out to be mostly drinking bowls and a good number of amphorae, most of them depicting men engaging in various forms of sexual intercourse, although there are some depicted mixed couples or orgies, and a few that only show women. You contemplated bringing some of them back with you but the sheer amount was more than your slavers could carry.

                Given the distance and the cover of the vegetation, your slavers were able to outrun the orcs, but it also meant they had to abandon the job and head back to the fort. You hoped the orcs might raid the caravan, but you later hear of its safe arrival at Lucgate.

Unfortunately, <<name $g.fighter>> knocked over a stack of crates, which fell with a series of loud crashes, followed by the sound of pottery breaking.<br>

        a nondescript section of road, almost lost under the sands of the desert, but marked with a weathered waystone with a number carved into it that's barely readable. <<name $g.raider>> thought it was a sixty seven. Or maybe a sixty nine.
