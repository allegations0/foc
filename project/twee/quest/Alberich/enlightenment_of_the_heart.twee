<<set _trap = ($gQuest.getTemplate().key == 'infiltration_of_the_heart')>>

<p>
One of your diligent slavers has successfully graduated the first phase of Master training at the Women's Academy of Light<<if _trap>>, despite actually being a man<</if>>.
<<set _vice = $dutylist.getUnitIfAvailable('viceleader')>>
<<if _vice>> Your vice leader, <<rep _vice>>, brings you
<<else>> You have now received <</if>>
a letter from the Academy, singing them praises as if to a proud
<<if $unit.player.isMale()>>father <<else>> mother <</if>>.
</p>
<p>
As the letter explains in lengthy, florid prose, the young
<<if _trap>>
"lady"
<<else>>
lady
<</if>>
shows true
promise, talent, and devotion, as needed to enter the ranks of those who know
the Inner Light, and bring its blessings to the world. In surmounting the
difficulties attendant on the course, and achieving Enlightenment of the
Mind, they has overcome all obstacles, penetrated all riddles,
taken a whetstone to their wits, and thus armed themself
on the way to obtaining all mysteries, all secrets, of the Light
Mage's knowledge. Now is their mind ready to mount the stair to
the next level of readiness, to obtain true riches from the Academy's
treasury of knowledge, and earn the admiration of all.
</p>
<p>
<i>The way these people write</i>, you think, <i>are we sure they're not from the Academy of Wind?</i>
</p>
<p>
Now, the letter goes on to say, to approach ever nearer the goal, it is necessary that their enlightened mind be combined with a purified heart . . .
</p>
<p>
<i><b>My</b> slavers?</i> you think. <i> A purified heart? A heart at all? Am
I throwing my money away here?</i>
</p>
<p>
. . . and the necessary spiritual exercises may be had at the Women's Academy
of Light, in return for an entirely reasonable tuition, barely a pittance in
comparison with the wisdom and world-healing lore that soon will be theirs. . .
</p>
<p>
<I>Nuts</i>, you think. <i>Can't they just blow somebody and get the spell book already?</i>
</p>
<p>
The letter reveals no such option; if you wish your slaver to continue at the
academy, it's another ten thousand for tuition. </p>

<<if _trap>>
<p>
And of course, since your slaver will need to disguise themself again, add another
ten thousand for the Potion of Illusion...
</p>
<</if>>

<p>
<<if $g.pupil.isMale()>>
After gulping down the Potion of Illusion and embarrasedly donning <<their $g.pupil>>
best dress,
<</if>>
<<Rep $g.pupil>> returned to the unimposing stone building in Lucgate, which
still houses the Women's Academy of Light. Again <<they $g.pupil>> is greeted
by the handsome, warm, but proper <<rep $g.master>>. For now only one
other student is present. They take their purifying baths,
change into white academic robes, and enjoy just one simple meal together.
After that the two are not to see each other for
the rest of the training. The spiritual exercises of the heart work best when
the pupil is isolated, but for the objects of <<their $g.pupil>> meditation
and <<their $g.pupil>> spiritual guide—in this case, <<rep $g.master>>
himself.
</p>

<p>
The prior course was austere, but this one is more so. <<Rep $g.pupil>>
pupil|is straitly given in charge that <<they $g.pupil>> is not to eat one
bite more than <<they $g.pupil>> is given at meals, and those are to be light
and infrequent. At breakfast <<they $g.pupil>> is to drink an alchemical
draught designed to intensify <<their $g.pupil>> feelings. <<They $g.pupil>>
is to sleep not one minute more than <<they $g.pupil>> is allowed by <<their
$g.pupil>> guide, and he will allow far less than <<they $g.pupil>> is
accustomed to. <<They $g.pupil>> is not to allow <<themself $g.pupil>> any
sexual release, not so much as a single erotic touch, and any violation of
this order will be grounds for immediate expulsion<<if $g.pupil.isMale()>>,
although this will probably for a completely different reason for your disguised slaver<</if>>.
<<Their $g.pupil>> mind
is to be bent entirely to the themes and meditations of the exercises, and
each day <<they $g.pupil>> is to write in a diary and confess to <<rep
$g.master>> all <<their $g.pupil>> failings in <<their $g.pupil>> devotion to
this.
</p>

<p>
Each day opens with a meditation on the Pure Light. But the main business of
the first week is an examination of <<reps $g.pupil>> own life and failings,
each exercise a meditation, and each meditation an hour. <<They $g.pupil>> is
to consider the Tale of the Sun Child, and all occasions when <<they
$g.pupil>> has done harm to a being no less harmless; and the Verse of the
Dark River, and how each of <<their $g.pupil>> meanest deeds has reverberated
to the harm of the world. Tale follows tale and reflection follows
reflection.
</p>

<p>
<<They $g.pupil>> is required to meditate on tales of mindless creatures
that, by their natures, do harm, show no gratitude, and know no other
way.
<<if $g.pupil.isHasTrait('race_catkin')>>
<<They $g.pupil>> is forced to
dwell on <<their $g.pupil>> own birth as a <<urace $g.pupil>>, on the cruel and predatory
ways of cats and cat-like beings, their readiness to torment their prey
before devouring it, and the presence of such fantasies in <<their $g.pupil>>
own dark dreams. <<They $g.pupil>> cannot but deeply question whether
such a being could know the ways of Light and bring healing to the
world.
<<elseif $g.pupil.isHasTrait('race_wolfkin')>> <<They $g.pupil>> is forced to
dwell on <<their $g.pupil>> own whelping as a werewolf, on the heartless
pack-hunting ways of <<their $g.pupil>> lupine sires that sometimes fill
<<their $g.pupil>> dreams. <<They $g.pupil>> cannot but deeply question
whether a born predator with the smell of blood in its
nostrils could know the ways of Light and bring healing to the world.
<<elseif $g.pupil.isHasTrait('race_greenskin')>> <<They $g.pupil>> is forced
to dwell on <<their $g.pupil>> birth and nature as <<urace $g.pupil>>, one of that
notorious race of debauched green-skinned rapists, on how <<their $g.pupil>>
very existence must surely rely on more forced ravishing than gentle
lovemaking, and the way <<their $g.pupil>> kind ravage the countryside and
terrorize all others. Could a sprig from such a fleshly,
degenerate race know the ways of Light and bring healing to the world?
<<elseif $g.pupil.isHasTrait('race_lizardkin')>> <<They $g.pupil>> is forced
to dwell on <<their $g.pupil>> ovoviviparous hatching as a dragonkin,
ultimate spawn of those haughty, winged tyrants who know the rest of the
world only as prey and a source of plunder, and who bring fear and strange
desire rather than love or happiness. <<They $g.pupil>> must
confront <<themself $g.pupil>> and ask how such a being could know the ways
of Light and bring healing to the world.
<<elseif $g.pupil.isHasTrait('race_demon')>> <<They $g.pupil>> is forced to
dwell <<their $g.pupil>> own corrupt spawning as a demon beyond the mists,
fashioned from birth to tempt and corrupt, not to guide and to soothe, and to
work subversion and pain, not wisdom and healing, and to bring the pleasure
that leads to pain and ruin. <<They $g.pupil>> must face the absurdity that
such a being, from its arrival a foul seed in the clean soil of this world,
might even <i>touch</i> the Pure Light, let alone master its ways and bring
healing to the world.
<<elseif $g.pupil.isHasTrait('race_elf')>> <<They $g.pupil>> is forced to
dwell on <<their $g.pupil>> long life and upbringing as an elf, one of those
haughty, aloof woodfolk who cannot flit through the trees in search of prey
without admiring their own fleetness, and sneering at the grossness of every
other kind; for whom a reflective forest pool is an
irresistible temptation to boundless self-admiration. In their disdain for
every other kind, did not the ancient elves subject their neko
foes to a most disgraceful living death in the Field of Moai? And the nature
of those sadistic monsters, who left those poor catfolk as eternal statues
with dildos up their backsides, is surely the nature of <<rep $g.pupil>>
<<themself $g.pupil>>, who yet imagines that <<they $g.pupil>> can summon the
pure light, and bring healing to the world.
<<else>> <<They $g.pupil>> is forced to dwell on <<their $g.pupil>> birth as
a <i>human</i>, the race that must have invented every evil on the earth,
that has never ceased killing and enslaving its own kind and every other. When <<their $g.pupil>> kind are not sweating their lives away or
plotting to do each other harm, they dull themselves with
drink or debauchery or amuse themselves with the most
degenerate games. Why, there are some who have never owned a
slave in their lives, yet would like to <i>imagine</i> themselves as chiefs
of a band of slavers. In their daydreams they cruelly capture, train, and
market their fellow beings amidst a life of lechery and
libertine adventures, dreamed up by the sickest minds human “civilization”
can produce. No race capable of such pastimes could be trusted with anything
good, and how can <<they $g.pupil>>, one of them, hope to know the ways of
Light and bring healing to the world? <</if>>
</p>

<p>
The thoughts are depressing and disturbing, exactly as they are meant to be.
Yet the next exercises are worse. By now <<their $g.pupil>> head is swimming
with fatigue and hunger, and <<they $g.pupil>> must meditate on tales of bad
character, the lazy wife whose children went hungry, the foul-mouthed
magistrate who worked the greatest injustice from a simple fit of bad temper.
<<They $g.pupil>> is encouraged to focus on pictures from these tales, and
see the petty spitefulness of the characters in their painted faces, and
where it leads. As the tales continue, each more than the last
seems written to stir the deepest distress and self-loathing within <<rep
$g.pupil>>—not just for <<their $g.pupil>> corrupt origins, but for the
ugliness within <<them $g.pupil>>, that has grown since the first day <<they
$g.pupil>> could think. <<Their $g.pupil>> smallest transgressions, <<their
$g.pupil>> most persistent vices, fill <<their $g.pupil>> mind for the hours
of the exercises, and mortify <<them $g.pupil>>.
<<if $g.pupil.isHasTrait('per_lunatic')>> <<They $g.pupil>> must confront
<<their $g.pupil>> own lunacy—and in <<their $g.pupil>> woozy, hungry,
sleep-deprived clarity, must ask <<themself $g.pupil>> whether
<<they $g.pupil>> is retreating from the realities of <<their $g.pupil>> own
badness into the comforting fog of a mad<<woman $g.pupil>>'s dreaming.
<</if>>

<<if $g.pupil.isHasTrait('per_lustful')>> <<They $g.pupil>> must face <<their
$g.pupil>> own unbridled lusts, and as the deprivations of the flesh take
hold of <<them $g.pupil>>, must face the truth that the creatures <<they
$g.pupil>> seeks to sate <<their $g.pupil>> lusts on have hearts as well as
bodies, and to simply take them at pleasure and for pleasure is to do
countless invisible injuries. <</if>>

<<if $g.pupil.isHasTrait('per_aggressive')>> <<They $g.pupil>> must face
<<their $g.pupil>> own wrathful ways, and see the pain even a single angry
word can cause. As a poet once said: “Drop an unkind word — or careless—in a
minute you forget / But ther's little waves a flowing, and
there's ripples circling yet / And perhaps in some sad heart a
mighty wave of tears you've stirred / And disturbed a life was happy, ere you
dropped that unkind word.” And how many such words <<they $g.pupil>> has
flung left and right, simply because there was hate in <<their
$g.pupil>> heart that wanted out, though <<they $g.pupil>> never imagined
where it might lead. <</if>>

<<if $g.pupil.isHasTrait('per_cruel')>> <<They $g.pupil>> must face the
cruelty in <<their $g.pupil>> heart and in <<their $g.pupil>> ways, and the
pleasure <<they $g.pupil>> has taken from the pain and humiliation of
others, and see how that passion to beat others
down and make them cringe and suffer brings only base and fleeting pleasure
to some, with lasting misery for others. <</if>>

<<if $g.pupil.isHasTrait('per_cruel') && $g.pupil.isHasTrait('per_evil')>>
Indeed, <<they $g.pupil>> must come to understand the outright sadism that
has animated <<their $g.pupil>> outwardly lovely frame, and the pain those
well-fashioned hands have inflicted for the sake of <<their $g.pupil>>
lubricious wishes, and what it has meant for the objects of
that pain, of whom <<they $g.pupil>> was thoughtless as <<they $g.pupil>>
sought only <<their $g.pupil>> own desires. <</if>>

<<if $g.pupil.isHasTrait('per_masochistic')>> Indeed, <<they $g.pupil>> must
come to understand the pleasure <<they $g.pupil>> has drawn from <<their
$g.pupil>> own pain, and from encouraging others to inflict it, and so to
bring out the worst in themselves—a worst they may inflict on others who do
not so wish it. <<Their $g.pupil>> own sexual desires may have brought much
unwelcome pain to others, and <<they $g.pupil>> must be mindful of
consequences. <</if>>

<<if $g.pupil.isHasTrait('per_sly')>> <<They $g.pupil>> must face <<their
$g.pupil>> long career of deception and lies, and reflect on how lies
multiply and feed on each other, leading to misery and mistrust, and the fog
of lies like <<theirs $g.pupil>> brings a Cloud of Corrupton upon the earth,
one that the Pure Light is meant to piece, but <<they $g.pupil>> <<themself
$g.pupil>> is its greatest enemy. <</if>>

<<if $g.pupil.isHasTrait('per_evil')>> Above all things, <<they $g.pupil>>
must confront the core of <i>evil</i> within <<themself $g.pupil>>, and the
parasitic ways of those who extract tribute from the world, not because
others are fools or weaklings, but because they are trying to live by a
decency <<they $g.pupil>> has not known and has never tried to comprehend.
<</if>>
</p>

<p>
And still the first week is not done, and the worst has not passed. As
<<their $g.pupil>> unsated hunger, <<their $g.pupil>> unfulfilled need for
sleep, and <<their $g.pupil>> unquenchable and increasing need for sexual
release continue, <<their $g.pupil>> daily confessions of stray thoughts grow
more tearful, and the images on which <<they $g.pupil>> must meditate grow
worse. <<They $g.pupil>> must bend <<their $g.pupil>> mind to tales of those
whose lives and livelihoods are an offense to their fellow beings, and who
live to hurt and live by hurt. And <<they $g.pupil>> can only see <<themself
$g.pupil>> in them, and ask what <<their $g.pupil>> life has been.
</p>

<p>
<<if $g.pupil.isHasTrait('bg_noble')>> Has <<they $g.pupil>> not been a
noble, supposedly the mainstay and fighting bulwark of any kingdom, yet too
often simply a pampered parasite, extracting <<their $g.pupil>> living and
pleasures from the sweat of honest folk? Precious little nobility in that.
<</if>>
<<if $g.pupil.isHasTrait('bg_mercenary')>> Has <<they $g.pupil>> not been a
mercenary, playing the savage game of war and contributing to the misery of
the world, not for king and country or loyalty and defense, but simply for a
bag of short-lived coin? The money goes fast, and the dead do not return.
<</if>>
<<if $g.pupil.isHasTrait('bg_pirate')>> Has <<they $g.pupil>> not been a
pirate, venturing where honest folk brave the waves for trade,
and plundering what they have earned and destroying what they have built, on
no higher ground than the fear <<they $g.pupil>> and <<their
$g.pupil>> mates could instill? The romance is for fools and children. The
reality is cruelty piled on cruelty. <</if>>
<<if $g.pupil.isHasTrait('bg_raider')>> Has <<they $g.pupil>> not been a
raider, a pirate of the land, ravaging and burning and bringing pain and
poverty, creating nothing and destroying all, simply to keep <<their
$g.pupil>> wretched life moving forward? Toenail fungus has a more beautiful
life. <</if>>
<<if $g.pupil.isHasTrait('bg_thug')>> Has <<they $g.pupil>> not been a thug,
pushing <<their $g.pupil>> way into the lives of those who wish only to live
and find a little happiness, and beating <<their $g.pupil>> living out of
their fear and humiliation? Those who do that inflict a thousand little
deaths on their weak and wretched victims. Pond scum brings more beauty to
the world. <</if>>
<<if $g.pupil.isHasTrait('bg_informer')>> Has <<they $g.pupil>> not been an
informer, trading on the trust of others, that sweetest prize of life, and
<i>betraying</i> it for nothing better than bread? It's hard to see how such
a creature could live with <<themself $g.pupil>> . <</if>>
<<if $g.pupil.isHasTrait('bg_thief')>> Has <<they $g.pupil>> not been a
thief, seeing around <<their $g.pupil>> a world of honest tradesmen and
lawful owners, ones who work and craft and obey while planning a little
security and luxury for themselves, and then simply <i>taking</i> what they
have rightly earned, while offering <<themself $g.pupil>> the flimsiest
excuses for what <<they $g.pupil>> did to them? Worse than worthless. <</if>>
<<if $g.pupil.isHasTrait('bg_whore')>> Has <<they $g.pupil>> not been a
whore, selling <<their $g.pupil>> lubricious services to all and sundry
without asking why, helping wayward husbands to break honest wives' hearts,
or tempting the poor and lonely to squander their little all for a moment's
pleasure, all built on lies and illusions of love? Disgusting. <</if>>
<<if $g.pupil.isHasTrait('bg_unemployed')>> Has <<they $g.pupil>> not been a
shiftless tramp, a pointless parasite, eating the bread made and earned by
the honest, and imagining this was freedom? Maggots contribute more to the
world. <</if>>
<<if $g.pupil.isHasTrait('bg_assassin')>> Has <<they $g.pupil>> not been a
cutthroat, an assassin, a murderess-for-hire, robbing others of the precious
gift of life itself, without even the boldness to face them as the
mercenaries do? Better things than <i><<they $g.pupil>></i> is may be found
dripping from a donkey's dong. <</if>>
Worst of all, and worst of all creatures, <<they $g.pupil>> has lived as a
<i>slaver</i>, and not just any slaver, but a slaver with that repulsive
company of <<rep $company.player>>, those foulest of flesh-traders, caring
nothing for the liberty of their fellow-beings, nor even for their lives
except as pieces of merchandise. That <<name $unit.player>> is simply a tyrant
on the largest scale <<they $unit.player>> can manage, and such a creature,
or anyone who could serve such a creature, lives and is a constant offense
before the Light. If ever the world produced a child of Belial, it is <<rep
$g.pupil>>.
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit' or $gOutcome == 'success'>>

<p>
At the end of the week, <<reps $g.pupil>> evening confessions are
increasingly tearful, and in <<their $g.pupil>> confused, deprived state,
<<they $g.pupil>> is not only wondering whether <<they
$g.pupil>> may be fit to receive and transmit the Pure Light. <<They
$g.pupil>> is wondering whether <<they $g.pupil>> is fit to
live and breathe at all. The first morning of the second week finds <<their
$g.pupil>> kneeling in a bare meditation chamber, lit only by a beam of pure
sunlight through a clear window, <<their $g.pupil>> face streaming with
tears, and <<their $g.pupil>> heart filled only with a wish to be cleansed of
all the horrors of the previous week.
</p>

<p>
And then—at least in part—<<their $g.pupil>> wishes are
granted. This week, <<their $g.pupil>> meditations are focused not merely on
tales, but on optical apparatus, arrangements of lenses and prims that focus
light both natural and magical, so that <<they $g.pupil>> may see how the
aberrations distort the image, but a well-ground lens can focus the light far
more than anything in Nature, and bring the smallest details into the
sharpest relief. A prism is not just a source of beauty, but a metaphor for
splitting the essential from the nonessential, and seeing what needs to be
seen.
</p>

<p>
The deprivations <<rep $g.pupil>> suffers may be worse than the first week,
but they do not seem so, as <<they $g.pupil>> masters—at least for now—the
worst of <<their $g.pupil>> fleshly needs. <<Their $g.pupil>> daily
confessions of aberrant thoughts become sparser and less tearful, as <<they
$g.pupil>> comes to see <<they $g.pupil>> can perfect <<themself $g.pupil>>,
and focus on the ideals before <<their $g.pupil>>.
</p>

<p>
<<They $g.pupil>> is allowed to remember the better parts of <<their
$g.pupil>> character now, to integrate them into <<their $g.pupil>> new and
nobler self, one that is worthy to wear the robe of a master healer.
<<if $g.pupil.isHasTrait('per_chaste')>> After all, <<they $g.pupil>> has
shown restraint in controlling <<their $g.pupil>> lustful desires, however
desirable <<they $g.pupil>> might be, and so kept <<themself $g.pupil>> from
breaking hearts and causing much harm. <</if>>
<<if $g.pupil.isHasTrait('per_lavish')>> It must be said, <<their $g.pupil>>
nature has always been generous and free-handed, and maybe <<their $g.pupil>>
small acts of kindness have brought more happiness than <<they $g.pupil>>
knew. <</if>>
<<if $g.pupil.isHasTrait('per_calm')>> It has to be allowed, <<they
$g.pupil>> has always been an island of patience and calm when others around
<<their $g.pupil>> were roiled, and has nipped many a pointless feud in the
bud with <<their $g.pupil>> quietude and willingness to listen. <</if>>
<<if $g.pupil.isHasTrait('per_humble')>> <<Their $g.pupil>> sincere desire
for simplicity has sometimes let <<their $g.pupil>> bring peace to others.
<</if>>
<<if $g.pupil.isHasTrait('per_logical')>> <<Their $g.pupil>> logical ways,
<<their $g.pupil>> ability to “see reason” when others cannot, has sometimes
done them a world of good. <</if>>
<<if $g.pupil.isHasTrait('per_empath')>> <<Their $g.pupil>> natural empathy,
<<their $g.pupil>> ability to see into the hearts of others and feel what
they feel, has sometimes brought them happiness or at least relief from their
sorrows. <</if>>
<<if $g.pupil.isHasTrait('per_loyal')>> There must be some
good inside anyone as naturally loyal as <<rep $g.pupil>>, even if that
loyalty is sometimes misplaced. <</if>>
<<if $g.pupil.isHasTrait('per_direct') ||
$g.pupil.isHasTrait('per_honorable')>> Whatever else may be said, <<rep
$g.pupil>> pupil|is a <<woman $g.pupil>> of <<their $g.pupil>> word, and
people know they can trust <<their $g.pupil>>. <</if>>
<<if $g.pupil.isHasTrait('per_kind')>> Above all, at heart, <<rep $g.pupil>>
pupil|is a kindly soul, who draws more pleasure from another's smile than
from anything else in life.<</if>>
<<Their $g.pupil>> best traits may not manifest every day, but they are
there, and <<they $g.pupil>> sees them more clearly now.
</p>
<p>
In time, <<rep $g.pupil>> pupil|is allowed to see that <i><<they
$g.pupil>></i>, even as <<they $g.pupil>> is, has worth; just as the ones
<<they $g.pupil>> must heal, whoever and whatever they may be, have worth;
and the best and the worst may become more whole in body and in mind. And
thus <<they $g.pupil>> achieves Enlightenment of the Heart, at least enough
to raise <<their $g.pupil>> another step on the way to Mastery.
</p>
<p>
On the final day, <<they $g.pupil>> enjoys a simple, communal meal with
<<their $g.pupil>> spiritual guide, <<rep $g.master>>, and <<their $g.pupil>>
one fellow pupil. The latter, a young lady from the vale, glows with a new
inner beauty, and <<rep $g.pupil>> realizes <<they $g.pupil>> is seeing a
reflection of <<their $g.pupil>> own enlightened, ennobled face. And <<their
$g.pupil>> master and guide, <<their $g.pupil>> beautiful, beautiful master
and guide, now brings effusive praise and even embraces <<their $g.pupil>>
chastely. Both pupils have withstood the darkness and conquered it, and taken
a step furt<<their $g.pupil>> into the Light. </p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>> <p> <<Rep $g.pupil>> <<themself $g.pupil>> has
overcome more ill than any other student this year. On <<reps $g.master>>
recommendation, the <i>curia honoris</i> of the Women's Academy of Light has
chosen to award <<their $g.pupil>> the Laurel of Lustration, which will not
only mean a beautifully calligraphed certificate, but a partial deferment of
<<their $g.pupil>> tuition. Which will at least please that suspicious
skinflint <<name $unit.player>>. </p> <</if>>

<p> <<Rep $g.pupil>> sleeps <<their $g.pupil>> last night at the Academy in
great peace.
<<set _pimp = $dutylist.getUnitIfAvailable('entertainmentpimp')>>
<<set _marketer = $dutylist.getUnitIfAvailable('marketer')>>
<<set _viceleader=$dutylist.getUnitIfAvailable('viceleader')>>
<<set _trainer=$dutylist.getUnitIfAvailable('trainer')>>
And then <<they $g.pupil>> returns to those roustabout slavers at <<rep
$company.player>>, where the whips are always cracking, the slaves are
constantly begging for mercy, and the filthy money from the flesh trade is
forever changing hands. </p>
<<if _pimp>> <p>The company's lascivious pimp, <<rep _pimp>>, sees <<their
$g.pupil>> in the courtyard and calls out. “Ahoy, sweet cheeks, want some
time with the duty slaves? It's on the house for your homecoming. 'least if
we all get to watch, it is. <<They _pimp>> leers and winks. </p> <</if>>
<<if _marketer>> <p> <<rep _marketer>>, the company's grasping marketer,
waves hello at <<their $g.pupil>> homecoming. “Say,” <<they _marketer>> says,
“while you were leaving the city, did you spot any down-and-outs with red
hair and a good pair of melons? I've got some specialty orders that'd make it
worth our while.” </p> <</if>>
<<if _trainer>> <p> On <<their $g.pupil>> way to the main offices, <<rep
$g.pupil>> passes <<rep _trainer>>, that martinet of a slavers' drill
sergeant. “Hope you're rested!” <<they _trainer>> barks sharply. “This week's
focus exercise is the weighted strapon thrust! For the ladies anyway. And
slackers get the receiving end, you get me?” <<They _trainer>> does a rude
pelvic swivel and cackles. </p> <</if>>
<<if _viceleader>> <p> At the main offices, the vice leader, <<rep
_viceleader>>, welcomes <<their $g.pupil>> back and fills <<their $g.pupil>>
in on the current training schedule. “I hope you haven't forgotten how to do
Obedience: Basic,” <<they _viceleader>> says. “We may be needing an extra
pair of hands to administer a few swats.” <<They _viceleader>> mimes a blow.
</p> <</if>>
<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>> <p> <<Reps $g.pupil>> Certificate of Purification
does indeed look nice on <<name $unit.player>> 's wall, something <<they
$unit.player>> can point to when wooing new buyers and dealers. </p> <</if>>

<p>
It's good to be home.
</p>

<<elseif $gOutcome == 'failure'>>

<p>
And still the first week is not done, and the worst has not passed. As
<<their $g.pupil>> unsated hunger, <<their $g.pupil>> unfulfilled need for
sleep, <<their $g.pupil>> unquenchable and increasing need for sexual release
continue, <<their $g.pupil>> diary, which should be full of contrition and
self-correction, is instead full of increasingly erotic drawings, most
involving <<themself $g.pupil>> and <<rep $g.master>>. <<Their $g.pupil>>
daily confessions of stray thoughts grow more tearful, to the point of agony
and past it.
</p>

<p>
“Oh, Pupilmaster <<rep $g.master>>, I am on fire…I cannot shake these lustful
daydreams. I try to force them away, but they come back and back again.”
<<They $g.pupil>> squirms and looks up at him with big, hungry eyes.
</p>

<p>
“You must,” he says. “and you can. They aren't so hard to understand.
Where do these thoughts seem to focus?”
</p>

<p>
“On you,” <<they $g.pupil>> says, wider-eyed still. “I know I should be
focused on my transgressions, but all I can think of is you. See!” <<They
$g.pupil>> promptly hands him <<their $g.pupil>> diary. He pages through it,
seeing the proper thoughts replaced by increasingly graphic drawings. As the
pictures grow more explicit, his face shows disturbance—and his body shows
desire.
</p>

<p>
He looks up sharply from a particularly well-executed coupling, surrounded
with words and arrows that would explain to the dullest child just what <<rep
$g.pupil>> pupil|want done to <<their $g.pupil>>, and by whom. He tries to
speak but can barely find his breath. “Think of your purification. Think of
the art, of the light…”
</p>

<p>
<<They $g.pupil>> seizes his <<uhands $g.master>>, stopping his breath completely with the
intensity of <<their $g.pupil>> desire. “I can't – Pupilmaster, help me! –
<<rep $g.master>>, help me! I don't <i>want</i> purification, I want…I want…
<i>copulation!</i> I don't <i>want</i> to be healed, I want to be fixed, I
don't <i>want</i> a shaft of true light, I want another shaft, I want
<i>your</i> shaft, and <i>I want it right now! </i>
</p>

<<if $g.pupil.isMale()>>

<p>
And just like that, the effect Potion of Illusion, which requires the drinker to be chaste to work
effectively, was broken.
The pupil was revealed for what <<they $g.pupil>> really is -- a male <<urace $g.pupil>>,
and was prompty expelled from the academy.
The tuition is extremely non-refundable, and you have never lost so much money
within such a short period of time...
</p>

<<else>>
<p>
There is not much more – <<they $g.pupil>> is tearing off <<their $g.pupil>>
robe, and he is trying to restrain <<their $g.pupil>>, but in going for
<<their $g.pupil>> wrists he finds <<their $g.pupil>> <<ubreasts $g.pupil>>,
and in minutes all forbearance is forgotten as he plunges into <<their
$g.pupil>> <<uvagina $g.pupil>>, ending the agony of abstention in a minute
of sweet delight. He is, after all, only human.
<<if $g.master.isHasTrait('race_elf') || $g.master.isHasTrait('race_catkin')
|| $g.master.isHasTrait('race_lizardkin') ||
$g.master.isHasTrait('race_wolfkin') ||
$g.master.isHasTrait('race_greenskin')>> Or <i>mortal</i>, anyway.
<<elseif $g.master.isHasTrait('race_demon')>>Or, rat<<their $g.pupil>>, he
isn't human, but a demon, and whatever the Discipline of Light has taught
him, <<rep $g.pupil>> pupil|have brought out his inner nature, in all its
monstrous lasciviousness. Beyond the mists, Lust ravages Seduction, and it
takes more than a change of locale and a few mental tricks to change the
nature of things. <</if>>
</p>

<p>
Pupilmaster <<rep $g.master>> can't bring himself to expel <<rep $g.pupil>>
after the pleasure they've shared. But his superiors in the Academy find out
quickly. They can and do discharge <i>him</i> and expel <<their $g.pupil>> in
the bargain. If <<name $unit.player>> ever gets another invitation, some other
master will administer the instruction, and they would probably prefer that
some other student receive it. But the tuition is extremely non-refundable.
</p>
<</if>>

<<else>>

<p>
At the end of the week, <<reps $g.pupil>> evening confessions are
increasingly tearful, and in <<their $g.pupil>> confused, deprived state,
<<they $g.pupil>> is not only wondering whether <<they $g.pupil>> may be fit
to receive and transmit the Pure Light. <<They $g.pupil>> is wondering
whether <<they $g.pupil>> is fit to live and breathe at all. The first
morning of the second week finds <<their $g.pupil>> kneeling in a bare
meditation chamber, lit only by a beam of pure sunlight through a clear
window, <<their $g.pupil>> face streaming with tears, and <<their $g.pupil>>
heart filled only with a wish to be cleansed of all the horrors of the
previous week.
</p>

<p>
<<Rep $g.master>> approaches <<their $g.pupil>> with a kindly look. “You have
done well, my child, better than you know.”
</p>

<p>
“I haven't,” responds <<rep $g.pupil>>. “I've polluted the academy with my
presence and desecrated the Pure Light with even my slight practice of it . .
. .”
</p>

<p>
“But this is the feeling every initiate must come to,” says the Pupilmaster,
“so that <<they $g.pupil>> may enter into a better Way with a purer heart.”
</p>

<p>
“You don't understand,” <<they $g.pupil>> replies. “Do you know who sent me
here? That <<uadjper $unit.player>>, <<uadjper $unit.player>>,
flesh-trading pervert-monster <<name $unit.player>>, from that beastly den of
ruffians, <<rep $company.player>>! I was studying <<lore magic_light>> to
help <i>them</i>, so they could recover from their dreadful adventures, and
heal the scars on their poor victims and fetch them a hig<<their $g.pupil>>
price . . .” – and here <<they $g.pupil>> breaks down in shame
and guilt.
</p>

<p>
You can guess the rest. <<They $g.pupil>> quits the slaving trade that very
day,<<if $g.pupil.isFemale()>>
and after a whirlwind romance marries <<their $g.pupil>> Pupilmaster.
They dedicate their lives to happiness and charity until misfortune overtakes
them, perhaps as divine recompense for <<their $g.pupil>> past bad deeds.
<<else>>
and last you heard <<therace $g.pupil>> decide to open a charity for war victims to prevent
them from being enslaved.
<</if>>
But
this is far from your knowing. All <i>you</i> know, for now at least, is that
you're out some 20,000 gold pieces in tuition, and have nothing to show for
it.
