:: Quest_werewolf_hunt [nobr]
<p>
Word has come to your fort that a <<female $g.ziggar>> <<urace $g.ziggar>>
has been seen terrorizing the small mountain settlements of the <<lore region_vale>>.
According to the villagefolk, the <<urace $g.ziggar>> has been
entering their homes at night and stealing their hard-earned gold, before
disappearing into the darkness.
So dire is the situation that the <<rep
$company.humanvale>> have commissioned your company <<rep $company.player>>
to take care of the threat, using any means upon which you deem necessary.
</p>

<<set _u = setup.getAnySlaver()>>

<p>
<<Yourrep _u>> points out that something is odd here — werewolves don't usually
go out alone under the cover of darkness to sneak around and steal goods.
These furry race usually prefers the more direct approach of simply
raiding the villages to the ground, so this could be a rare outcast of the werewolves,
which could present an opportunity for you to capture one without too many repercussions.
Dealing with any <<urace $g.ziggar>> will be no easy task, however.
First, you will need a good spotter in order to locate the
<<urace $g.ziggar>> in it's surely hidden hideout, and then two
hunters in order to take <<them $g.ziggar>> down and capture <<them
$g.ziggar>>.
It will not be an easy mission, but the money will
(hopefully?) be well worth it.
</p>

<<questimage 'werewolf_hunt.jpg'>>

<p>
Adventuring into the icy peaks of the <<lore region_vale>>, <<yourrep $g.spotter>>
spotter|was able to <<uadv $g.spotter>> locate and track
the <<urace $g.ziggar>>'s footsteps back into <<their $g.ziggar>> hiding
place:
a small cave on
<<if $gQuest.getSeed() % 3 == 0>>
the side of a mountain.
<<elseif $gQuest.getSeed() % 3 == 1>>
the side of an icy river.
<<else>>
the underside of a cliff.
<</if>>
Entering with caution, your
<<uadjphys $g.hunter1>> hunter <<rep $g.hunter1>> and your <<uadjphys
$g.hunter2>> hunter <<rep $g.hunter2>> caught the <<urace $g.ziggar>>
completely by surprise, and
<<set _water = setup.selectUnit([$g.spotter, $g.hunter1, $g.hunter2], {trait: 'magic_water'})>>
<<set _earth = setup.selectUnit([$g.spotter, $g.hunter1, $g.hunter2], {trait: 'magic_earth'})>>
<<set _muscle = setup.selectUnit([$g.spotter, $g.hunter1, $g.hunter2], {trait: 'muscle_strong'})>>
<<if _water>>
<<rep _water>> used <<their _water>> water magic to freeze <<them $g.ziggar>> in <<their $g.ziggar>> step and
<<elseif _earth>>
<<rep _earth>> used <<their _earth>> earth magic to conjure binding vines and
<<elseif _muscle>>
<<rep _muscle>> used <<their _muscle>> considerable muscles
<<else>>
<<rep $g.spotter>> immediately charged in
<</if>>
to try and capture <<them $g.ziggar>>.
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>

<p>
Surprisingly, the <<urace $g.ziggar>> offered little resistance, and was
quickly overpowered before being bound and gagged by your hunters.
The reason, as was discovered, was quite obvious: the werewolf was rather scrawny for one of its race,
and must be one of the many reasons that the poor thing had been exiled from <<their $g.ziggar>>
pack.
Satisfied with the outcome, your
slavers collected their reward and made their way back to the fort, having
not only gained a decent sum of cash and a little more favor with the <<rep
$company.humanvale>>, but also a new and <<uadjphys $g.ziggar>> <<urace $g.ziggar>>
slave to have fun with.
</p>

<<else>>

<p>
Unfortunately for <<them $g.hunter2>>, the werewolf was a particularly tough and strong one, perhaps
exiled from <<their $g.ziggar>> pack after attempting to challenge <<their $g.ziggar>> alpha.
The <<urace $g.ziggar>> fought back fiercely, claws clashing with <<reps $g.hunter2>> <<uweapon $g.hunter2>>,
but seeing no hope of victory given that <<they $g.ziggar>> ziggar|was clearly
outnumered made the wise decision to
charge out of the cave at the first opportunity, dissapearing into the snowy lands before any of your slavers could stop <<them $g.ziggar>>.
</p>

<p>
Despite the escape, the werewolf seemed to have decided that the area was simply too well-guarded — or perhaps your hunter's performance was just good enough to scare <<them $g.ziggar>> away —
and was never seen around the area again.
For driving away the nuisance, your slavers were paid
handsomely, as well as gaining a little bit more favour with the <<rep $company.humanvale>>.
</p>

<</if>>



:: Quest_werewolf_huntFailure [nobr]
<p>
Despite your <<uadjphys $g.spotter>> spotter <<reps $g.spotter>> best
efforts, <<they $g.spotter>> was unable to locate the <<urace $g.ziggar>>
amidst the icy peaks of the <<lore region_vale>>.
Your slavers had to return to the settlement empty-handed, who lost trust in your company's
abilities to solve their problems.
</p>



:: Quest_werewolf_huntDisaster [nobr]

<<questimage 'werewolf_hunt.jpg'>>

<p>
Adventuring into the icy peaks of the <<lore region_vale>>, <<yourrep $g.spotter>>
spotter|was able to <<uadv $g.spotter>> locate and track
the <<urace $g.ziggar>>'s footsteps back into <<their $g.ziggar>> hiding
place:
a small cave on
<<if $gQuest.getSeed() % 3 == 0>>
the side of a mountain.
<<elseif $gQuest.getSeed() % 3 == 1>>
the side of an icy river.
<<else>>
the underside of a cliff.
<</if>>
Entering seemingly without care,
<<if $g.hunter1.isHasTrait('per_cautious')>>
a rare thing given how cautious <<therace $g.hunter1>> normally hunter1|is,
<</if>>
<<yourrep $g.hunter1>> and <<utheirrel $g.hunter1 $g.hunter2>>
<<rep $g.hunter2>>
found the cavern completely deserted.
Ready to leave empty-handed, your slavers turned their backs around and were horrified to discover that the
<<uadjgood $g.ziggar>> <<urace $g.ziggar>> was waiting for them at the
entrance, having seemingly spotted them coming before they could get there.
<<Rep $g.spotter>>, who had been left alone outside the cave,
had already been overpowered by the <<urace $g.ziggar>> and laid unconscious at <<their
$g.ziggar>> side.
</p>

<p>
With no other way out, your slavers fought their way against the powerful enemy,
and while they were able to escape, they suffered a great many injuries and had to
stumble their way out of the <<urace $g.ziggar>>'s lair while
carrying <<rep $g.spotter>> with them.
</p>
