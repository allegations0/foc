:: Quest_sunken_barge_i [nobr]

<p>
Your slavers efforts have finally paid off.
Somehow, they actually found an actual lead, which might lead to an actual treasure.
</p>

<p>
The northerners of old hated the <<lore race_humankingdom>>s, and it showed in their tales.
According to the tale,
some years ago a lavish pleasure barge belonging to a princeling from Lucgate was meandering up the river in the <<lore region_vale>> when disaster struck and the barge was sunk.
The story then told in great raunchy details what happened to the survivors, but that's
not the part of the tale that interests you.
What you are interested in is the sunken vessel, no doubt brimming with lost treasure.
</p>

<p>
It might still be a while until you can get your grubby <<uhands $unit.player>> on the treasure.
You'd still need to locate the sunken vessel. This would no doubt require a strong swimmer, and you
probably should select one among your slavers, unless you're up for the job yourself.
</p>


:: Quest_sunken_barge_iCrit [nobr]

<p>
The days were long -- your slavers scoured the riverbanks daily and swam in the icy river water,
seeking the sunken barge.
Fortunately, the hard cold work paid off when <<rep $g.spotter>> spotted something on the river bottom that looks very much like two halves of a large boat.
</p>

<p>
It's up to <<yourrep $g.explorer>> to verify that the sighting is true.
<<if $g.explorer.isNaked()>>
Not wearing any clothings from the beginning,
<<else>>
So after stripping out of <<their $g.explorer>> <<uequipment $g.explorer>>,
<</if>>
<<they $g.explorer>> took a deep breath before diving into the river,
leaving <<rep $g.spotter>> and <<rep $g.support>> to watch expectedly from the riverbank.
</p>

<p>
After a few suspenseful moments
<<if $g.explorer.isHasTrait('race_lizardkin')>>
<<reps $g.explorer>> <<ueyes $g.explorer>> breached the river's' surface,
before <<their $g.explorer>> <<therace $g.explorer>> <<uadjphys $g.explorer>> form exited from the water to rejoin <<their $g.explorer>> companions.
<<else>>
<<rep $g.explorer>> emerged from the river gasping for breath before swimming back into the riverbank where <<their $g.explorer>> companions were waiting.
<</if>>

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
A fine prize were held in <<their $g.explorer>> <<uhand $g.explorer>> --
an elegantly wrought fragments of a silver ship's lantern, a clear proof of the barge's value.
<</if>>
<<if $g.explorer.getSpeech() == setup.speech.friendly>>
"We've found it friends, a barge full of treasure for no one else but us to loot!," <<rep $g.explorer>> announced with a smile!
<<elseif $g.explorer.getSpeech() == setup.speech.bold>>
"That barge is right down there, full of treasure for the taking," <<rep $g.explorer>> announced boldly!
<<elseif $g.explorer.getSpeech() == setup.speech.cool>>
"Looks like we have a barge to loot," <<rep $g.explorer>> informed them.
<<elseif $g.explorer.getSpeech() == setup.speech.witty>>
"It's down there alright, the snails kept the jewelries clean too, if you know what I mean," <<rep $g.explorer>> announced with a grin.
<<elseif $g.explorer.getSpeech() == setup.speech.debauched>>
"We've found the barge, no lusty river naiads in attendance, but plenty of booty," <<rep $g.explorer>> announced!
<</if>>
</p>

<p>
It seemed your slavers had found the sunken barge!
The only task remaining is to properly loot the ship,
and a final mission has been prepared for you to follow it up.
</p>


:: Quest_sunken_barge_iFailure [nobr]
<p>
Led by <<rep $g.spotter>>, your slavers spent the week scouring through the riverbanks with eyes peeled for any sign of the barge and the rich treasure it may hold.
Yet day after day pass, and the only thing <<rep $g.explorer>> received for the trouble of diving into the chilly river were the wet and cold it brought.
While your slavers had no success in their mission, there was still much of the river to explore and they may yet find the sunken barge in another attempt.
</p>



:: Quest_sunken_barge_iDisaster [nobr]

<p>
Initially excited, after days scouring the riverbanks without any clue, your slavers became
more and more desperate.
After spotting a shadowy form in the cold river, <<rep $g.explorer>> immediately dived in to investigate only to discover a fierce river beast that was none too happy to receive a visitor.
<<rep $g.support>> support|was able to pull <<therace $g.explorer>> to safety, but not without them both suffering some bites from the unpleasant beast.
The search will have to continue later, after they recover or with another team.
</p>
