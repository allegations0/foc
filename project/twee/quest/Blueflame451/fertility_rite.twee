<p>
There does not seem to be any end to the superstitious beliefs of the folk of the <<lore region_vale>>. 
Were one be creative enough,
there are actually plenty of opportunities from using these beliefs for some fun and profit.
If you think your enterprising company is up for the task, then read on...
</p>

<p>
Among these beliefs, there is a tale of an old fertility rituals,
said to bestow blessings onto the land, livestock and the wombs of people.
With a small investment to secure the right garb and paraphernalia you might be able convince the simple northerners to partake in your earthy and sexual fertility rites.
Of course a slaver that understands the workings of the fields and livestocks is good.
If they know alchemy or actual Earth magic, then that's even better.
You'll also need a (lucky) slaver with a ready cock, or “holy phallus,” to be worshiped, and a reliable guard to collect and protect the tribute these gullible folk would no doubt pay for your slaver's holy services.
</p>



:: Quest_fertility_riteCrit [nobr]
<p>
Donning their new robes, setting out the ritual accountrements, and pitching their tent on a hill overlooking a village, your slavers are ready to hold their "holy" sex rites.
<<Rep $g.guard>> <<uadv $g.guard>> invited the people of the nearby village to come receive the sacred fertility blessing.
</p>

<<set _shepherdess = 'shepherd'>>
<<if $g.shepherd.isFemale()>> <<set _shepherdess = 'shepherdess'>>
<</if>>

<p>
The first visitor was a timid <<= _shepherdess>> hoping to hear prayers for the nannies of
<<their $g.shepherd>> flock. While <<rep $g.biologist>> administered to the goats, the
<<= _shepherdess>> was told to enter into the tent where <<rep $g.phallus>> lied in wait.
There, <<they $g.shepherd>> knelt in "prayer" with the assistance of <<yourrep $g.phallus>>,
who <<uadv $g.phallus>> convinced the <<= _shepherdess>> to worship <<their $g.phallus>> <<udick $g.phallus>> as part of the ritual.

<<if $g.phallus.isHasTrait('dick_titanic')>>
  The titanic dick was so very large, easily hypnotizing the <<= _shepherdess>>.
<<elseif $g.phallus.isHasTrait('dick_huge')>>
  The huge dick was so very, almost hypnotizing the <<= _shepherdess>>.
<<elseif $g.phallus.isHasTraitExact('dick_small')>>
  The tiny dick was so unnaturally small, poking the curiosity of the innocent <<= _shepherdess>>.
<</if>>

A long while later, after many smooching noises the blushing <<= _shepherdess>> exited the tent, face red, before collecting <<their $g.shepherd>> flock and leaving.
However it was with a secret smile that <<they $g.shepherd>> praised the sacred ritual to <<their $g.shepherd>> interested neighbors and soon the fertility blessings were much sought after,
for <<they $g.shepherd>> was much impressed by <<reps $g.phallus>> <<upraisenoun $g.phallus>> (and also <<their $g.phallus>> <<uballs $g.phallus>>).
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
<p>
In the coming days many <<women $g.shepherd>> from the village, including
<<if $g.shepherd.isFemale()>>
wives, widows and daughters,
<<else>>
husbands, widows, and sons,
<</if>>
came to receive their blessings, all eagerly slobbering or bouncing on <<rep $g.phallus>> <<udick $g.phallus>>,
<<if $g.phallus.isHasTrait('per_chaste')>>
much to the embarrassment of the chaste slaver.
<<elseif $g.phallus.isHasTrait('per_lustful')>>
to the great delight of the lustful slaver.
<<else>>
earning your slavers a lot of coins.
<</if>>
Of course <<rep $g.biologist>> stayed busy offering good advice on how to care for the "newly blessed" fields, livestock, or bodies, but many attendees seemed more interested in <<reps $g.phallus>> "holy rites". Some even returned to beg for additional blessings!
</p>

<p>
<<Rep $g.guard>> collected and secured all the generous tributes in the trusty strongbox for their eventual return to the <<rep $company.player>>.
</p>

<<else>>

<p>
Your slavers made a tidy profit exploiting these poor people seeking the holy blessing.
<<Rep $g.phallus>> <<uadv $g.phallus>> enticed many villager to worship <<their $g.phallus>> <<udick $g.phallus>>, while <<rep $g.biologist>> made sure to give actual advice on how to care their "newly blessed" fields, livestock, or bodies.
</p>

<p>
Overall the venture is a complete success, with your slavers bagging quite a heavy bag of gold.
</p>

<</if>>


:: Quest_fertility_riteFailure [nobr]

<p>
Unfortunately, for one reason or another the scheme just did not draw the worshippers your
slavers were hoping for.
Except for that one <<man $g.shepherd>> who kept coming back for more,
the rest of the villagers never become excited for the service.
Many that did come seeking blessing remain unconvinced and skeptical.
The amount of tithe suffered as a result, and
your slavers only managed to bring in a portion of the expected profit.
</p>


:: Quest_fertility_riteDisaster [nobr]

<p>
In the mission, your slavers learned the hard way that
not every village in the <<lore region_vale>> is full of superstitious simpletons.
The particular village they were trying to dupe
didn't like <<rep $g.phallus>> <<uadjbad $g.phallus>> take on holy prayer.
In fact, the moment <<their $g.phallus>> <<udick $g.phallus>> came out from under <<their $g.phallus>> robe, it was all over...
</p>

<p>
The angry villagers tore your slavers' robes off their backs and trampled on the ritual tent.
While the team's guard <<rep $g.guard>> guard|was able to make sure everyone got away from the mob in one piece, there was no way to recoup the material cost spent on this venture.
</p>
