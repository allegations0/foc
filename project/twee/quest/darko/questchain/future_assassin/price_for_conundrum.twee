:: Quest_price_for_conundrum [nobr]

<p>
They say what comes around, goes around. Per the suggestion of your slaver,
you are to revisit the wizard of the southern islands, the one who some time
ago asked for a supply of human batteries to fuel <<their $g.wizard>> ritual.
But this time, you are to pay for <<their $g.wizard>> expertise to solve a
conundrum you face.
</p>

<p>
And you better get ready to bring your fattest purse, as it won't be cheap at
all. In fact, most of the money you received from <<them $g.wizard>> last
time would have to be returned, which will surely earn you a smirk from the
<<uadjgood $g.wizard>> wizard.
</p>

<p>
But at least <<they $g.wizard>> might reveal the answer to you, including the
identity of the mysterious assailant. And what greater wealth is there than
knowledge?
</p>


:: Quest_price_for_conundrumCrit [nobr]

<p>
You swore the wizard was expecting you coming back to <<their $g.wizard>>
humble abode. A small cup of tea has been prepared for three people — one for
<<themself $g.wizard>> and two for you and <<yourrep $g.battery>>. <<They
$g.wizard>> <<uadv $g.wizard>> took your money, before making <<themself
$g.wizard>> comfortable to begin the explanation.
</p>

<p>
What you are most likely facing here is a time traveler, likely from the
future. Although traveler is perhaps a misnomer here, as it is impossible for
anyone to willingly go to the past even via magic. No, all travelers from the
future are here because they were pulled from their timeline.
Going from the description of <<their $g.child>> face, the wizard's best
guess is that this would be the child of yours and <<yourrep $g.battery>> that
somehow got pulled into this timeline.
<<if $unit.player.getGender() == $g.battery.getGender()>>
Even though in this timeline the both of you are of the same gender, it is
not necessarily so in some other timeline.
<</if>>
</p>

<p>
To make matters worse, in this timeline you are not lovers with <<rep
$g.battery>>. If this continues, then unfortunately the mysterious
assailant would cease to be. This is probably why <<they $g.child>> child|was
so intent on kidnapping your current lover, probably just to separate the two
of you as much as possible to make <<their $g.child>> existence possible.
</p>

<p>
By the time the wizard finished explaining, you and <<yourrep $g.battery>>
got more confused than ever. But at least it was money well-spent — if the 
was true, then surely the mysterious assailant would have no choice but to
come to your fort should an imminent "accident" were to befall <<yourrep
$g.battery>>. After some explaining, <<rep $g.battery>> reluctantly agree to
fake a falling out with you, resulting in <<their $g.battery>> soon (faked)
lynching...
</p>

<p>
Before you leave, the wizard gave you a final (but at least it's free this time) warning.
Sooner or later, you would have to choose between love or a life, for if you continue on with your
current lover, then the law of time will rule that the child cannot exist, and hence will disappear from
the world...
</p>

<p>
That sounds like a big headache to think about, but at least you don't have to make the decision now.
Time to get back to your fort and end this charade once and for all.
</p>

<p>
The wizard never told you or your slavers that it was <<their $g.wizard>> own botched future box delivery
that started the whole affair.
</p>
