<<set _u = setup.getUnit({tag: "future_assassin_parent"})>>

<<if !_u>>
  <<missingunitquest>>
<<else>>
<p>
Armed with the expensive knowledge you bought from the wizard of the south, you have setup a plan.
You will denounce <<yourrep _u>> for insubordination, and will ship <<them
_u>> off as a slave to some faraway land, to never been seen again in <<lore
geo_mestia>>. A slaver will then be sent to spread the word out, while
you and <<rep _u>> will try your best to make the ruse convincing.
</p>

<p>
With luck, your little future assassin will have no choice but attempt a rescue for <<their $g.child>> <<mother _u>>, which will present an opportunity for you to finally end this nuisance once and for all.
</p>
<</if>>

<p>
You bought as many tomatoes as possible from nearby villages before putting
<<yourrep $g.victim>> on a the most comfortable pillory you've ever made,
and squashing as many tomatoes as possible around the area. As long as they
don't come too close, the scene
looked gory and scary, just as you wanted. <<Rep $g.victim>> will just
have to bear staying in the awkward position for a little while. In the
meantime, <<yourrep $g.crier>> <<uadv $g.crier>> spread the word around
nearby settlements, hopefully reaching the ears of your future assassin.
</p>

<p>
Sure enough, the trap worked. After a few weeks, a shuffling noise could be
heard from the courtyard, followed by an abrupt scream. Looking outside, you
were satisfied to see that someone had apparently fallen into the pit trap you
set under the pillory.
After waking <<yourrep $g.victim>> up (since it was night and the pillory was actually
substituted with a straw man at night),
you head together to the courtyard, and, lo and behold, an unconscious <<girl $g.child>>
was stuck deep down within the pit trap.
There was no mistaking it, <<their $g.child>> face really did resemble yours
and <<reps $g.victim>> face.
</p>

<p>
But now, the final warning of the wizard rings in your head. You have to make a decision.
<<set _lover = $unit.player.getLover()>>
<<if _lover && _lover != $g.victim>>
If you continue to love <<rep _lover>>, and not <<rep $g.victim>>, then the child will disappear...
<</if>>
Would you love a stranger, just to save a life?
</p>


:: Quest_future_assassinFailure [nobr]

<p>
Unfortunately, even after few weeks of waiting, your assailant was nowhere to
be seen. After four weeks of nothing, you gave up on this, with nothing but
aches on <<reps $g.victim>> entire body to show for your efforts.
Perhaps you can try again once <<yourrep $g.victim>> recovers.
</p>
