:: Quest_stolen_flame [nobr]
<p>
Once work is done, you make it a habit to seek out your lover <<rep $g.lover>>. You have already known <<their $g.lover>> routine quite well by now.
At this time of the day, <<therace $g.lover>> lover|is usually busy <<uhobbyverb $g.lover>>.
But when you go over to <<their $g.lover>> place, your love is nowhere to be seen.
</p>

<p>
Well, you normally would not be so worried,
<<if $g.lover.isHasTrait('per_independent') or $g.lover.isHasTrait('per_loner')>>
you know and love <<them $g.lover>> for <<their $g.lover>> lonely nature after all,
<<else>>
<<they $g.lover>> occasionally enjoys having an alone time after all,
<</if>>
but recent events came to your mind. Some time ago, a mysterious assailant did try to assault your lover.
Did they actually succeeded this time?
</p>

<<set _u = setup.getAnySlaver([$g.lover])>>
<p>
As you started to worry, <<yourrep _u>> came with both a good and bad news.
The good news is that <<therace _u>> found out where your lover had gone to.
The bad news is that your lover had indeed been kidnapped by the mysterious assailant,
but <<rep _u>> was able to track the disappearance down to a certain village in the <<lore region_vale>>.
</p>

<<set _v = setup.getUnit({
tag: "future_assassin_parent"
})>>
<<if _v>>
<p>
Rescuing your lover is of utmost importance to you, and you will surely not want to miss it. But to your surprise, <<rep _v>> also insisted on going with you. <<Yourrep _v>> has always been known for <<their _v>> magical abilities — perhaps they have a vision that might help?
</p>
<</if>>

<p>
Either way, best to get your ass moving straight away.
If there is any consolation, you know your lover well enough that even without your help, <<they $g.lover>> will surely be able to escape from <<their $g.lover>> predicament, and make it back home on <<their $g.lover>> own eventually. But without your help, <<they $g.lover>> will take a very, very long time...
</p>


:: Quest_stolen_flameCrit [nobr]

<p>
With the help of <<yourrep $g.tracker>>,
you and your team managed to track down <<rep $g.lover>> down to a port settlement on the north. Just as you entered, you see <<rep $g.lover>> being ushered into what appeared to be a pirate ship. They were selling your lover off as if <<they $g.lover>> lover|is some nameless slave!
</p>

<p>
Angered, you raised your <<uweapon $g.you>> and charged into the foray, with <<yourrep $g.tracker>> right behind you. Although you were few in number, you had a wealth of experience on your side, and these wannabe slavers were no match for yours and your slaver's prowess in combat. You headed directly for your <<rep $g.lover>>, and the two of you embraced for the first time these past weeks while <<rep $g.tracker>> watched <<uadv $g.tracker>>.
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
<p>
Fortunately, your lover appeared to be completely unscathed by the ordeal, suffering only minor trauma from the entire trial.
</p>
<<elseif $gOutcome == 'success'>>
<p>
Your lover suffered minor injuries from the trial, but nothing a poultice or two cannot heal. The mind trauma will take a little longer to heal, however.
</p>
<<else>>
<p>
It seems the trials were not kind to <<rep $g.lover>>. <<They $g.lover>> looked terrible, with bruises and cuts everywhere, not to mention the look in <<their $g.lover>> face.
</p>
<</if>>

<<set _father = $unit.player>>
<<set _mother = $g.parent>>

<<if !_father.isHasDick()>>
<<set _mother = $unit.player>>
<<set _father = $g.parent>>
<</if>>

<<set _preference = $settings.getGenderPreference(setup.job.slaver)>>

<<if Math.random() < 0.5>>
<<set _preference = $settings.getGenderPreference(setup.job.slave)>>
<</if>>

<<set _w = setup.UnitBirth.generateChild(_father, _mother, _preference)>>

<p>
All these time however, <<yourrep $g.parent>> parent|was nowhere to be seen. Unbeknownst to you, <<rep $g.parent>> observed a very familiar-looking stranger who showed deep concern while watching the entire thing unfolds. <<Yourrep $g.parent>> <<uadv $g.parent>> sneaked up into the stranger, before launching a surprise leap onto <<them _w>>.
<<Rep $g.parent>> managed to grope <<their _w>> <<ubreasts _w>> before removing the assailant's hood, revealing <<their _w>> face. To <<reps $g.parent>> shock, it deeply resembled
<<if _w.getSubrace() == $unit.player.getSubrace()>>
you, as if <<they _w>> is your own child. But <<rep $g.parent>> could also see traces of <<their $g.parent>> own face there.
<<else>>
<<their $g.parent>> own, as if <<they _w>> is <<their $g.parent>> own child. <<Rep $g.parent>> could also see traces of you (yes, you) in the assailant's face.
<</if>>
But what could this mean?
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, the assailant used the distraction to break free of your <<urace $g.parent>> slaver's hold, before escaping in a gusto, leaving you and <<rep $g.parent>> with this very odd conundrum.
</p>

<p>
You were about to just shrug all of it as a coincidence before <<rep $g.parent>> insisted that this is far from a simple coincidence.
In fact, <<they $g.parent>> suggested you to go back to a certain wizard in the <<lore region_sea>>, who may actually know the answer to this conundrum. You sighed, knowing that the wizard's services won't come cheap...
</p>

  setup.costUnitHelper(_w)
