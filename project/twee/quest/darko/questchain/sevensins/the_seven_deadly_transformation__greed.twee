<<set _headunit = setup.getUnit({job: setup.job.slave, title: "seven_deadly_transformation"})>>
<<if !_headunit>>
<<dangertext "Due to your company missing a slave important for this quest, this quest is no longer able to be completed.">>
<<else>>
<p>
You had a very vivid dream where in which you saw one of your slaves <<rep
_headunit>> ventures into the forest in search of the "Master Rod", hidden
somewhere in the forest.
</p>

<p>
Initially, you dismissed the dream as nothing but a dream. But it kept
reoccurring to the point where you are now very certain that this dream is an omen
— it is yet another step you need to take in order to complete <<reps _headunit>> supposed
destiny. You could try to send a group of slavers to follow up on this
extremely vague lead. You would need a good scout as well as a good biologist
to get the best lay of the forest.
</p>

<</if>>

<p>
Your scout <<rep $g.scout>> <<uadv $g.scout>> guided the rest of the team
deep within the forest, until they arrived at a pristine grove.
Inside the grove was a hollowed out tree, and within it they found nothing but a wooden
phallus sticking out from a tree stump.
Certain that the "phallus" must be the "Master Rod" in your dream,
your slavers tried to make <<rep $g.fated>>
do various lewd things to activate the master rod.
But neither the forced deepthroating nor the assrape triggered anything within the slave and your slavers
were at a lost.
</p>

<p>
It was then that an elderly elf came upon your slavers. Introducing <<themself
$g.elf>> as the grove keeper, <<they $g.elf>> revealed that another component
was required in order to complete the ritual — the ritual demanded that the
greed be satisfied, so one dildo was not enough.
It was then that the elf reveals
<<if $g.elf.isHasDick()>>
his massive dick hidden beneath his clothes
<<else>>
her massive strap-on hidden beneath her clothes
<</if>>.
Your slavers, understanding what was supposed to be done,
gagged and carried the poor slave <<rep $g.fated>> for what they anticipate
to be an excruciatingly painful double penetration by an elf and the massive wooden
phallus.
<<if $g.fated.isHasTrait(setup.trait.anus_gape)>>
Still, <<their $g.fated>> gaping anus had plenty of experience and will
probably be able to withstood the rape.
<<else>>
Your slaver even doubted that the slave's relatively tight anus could possibly accomodate
just the elf's member, let alone together with the wooden phallus.
<</if>>
But just as the head of the phallus grazed the slave's hole, a green-ish glow
surrounded the asshole of the slave — within moments, both the phallus and the
elf's <<if $g.elf.isHasDick()>> dick <<else>> strap-on<</if>> were deep
within <<reps $g.fated>> ass, moving up and down, double penetrating <<them
$g.fated>>, who kept muffling from great amount of pain. As the double penetration
continued, <<reps $g.fated>> ears began to glow as well, morphing into sharp
ears akin to those of elves. The ritual continued for quite some time and
eventually, the green glow faded which signaled the end of the ritual.
</p>

<p>
<<Rep $g.fated>> immediately collapsed, having been fully exhausted from
<<their $g.fated>> ordeal. Having done <<their $g.elf>> duty, the elf bid
your team farewell. Your slavers had a
little fun with the fully used slave before heading back, successful in their
mission.
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
<p>
As your slavers headed back home, <<rep $g.biologist>> <<uadv $g.biologist>>
collected several valuable plants along the way, earning you some extra coin.
</p>
<</if>>

<p>
Your scout <<rep $g.scout>> <<uadv $g.scout>> guided the rest of the team
deep within the forest, until they stumbled upon a pristine grove.
Inside the grove is a hollowed out tree, and within they found nothing but a wooden
phallus sticking out from a tree stump.

<<if $gOutcome == 'failure'>>

Certain that the "phallus" must be
the "Master Rod" in your dream, your slavers tried to make <<rep $g.fated>>
do various lewd things to activate the master rod.
After your slavers subjected <<rep $g.fated>> to various degrading acts on
the rod, including a forced deepthroat and painful assrape, nothing seemed to trigger any
reaction.
Your slavers eventually ran out of ideas, and decided to go home.
Perhaps they could try this again sometime later.

<<else>>

But they were not alone in the grove.
Wild animals guarded the grove, and they viciously attacked your
team. Your slavers had to escape bearing injuries from the sudden and
unexpected attack.
