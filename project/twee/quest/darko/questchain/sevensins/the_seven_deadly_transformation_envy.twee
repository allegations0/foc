<<dangertext "Due to your company missing a slave important for this quest, this quest is no longer able to be completed.">>
<<else>>

<p>
In the recent days, <<yourrep _headunit>> is often found staring blankly
eastwards towards the <<lore region_desert>>, as if something was calling <<them
_headunit>> there. <<ustripmouth _headunit>> When you asked <<them _headunit>>
about it, <<they _headunit>> <<uadv _headunit>> indicated that <<they
_headunit>> kept hearing seductively disturbing voices in their head coming
from somewhere in the deserts.
</p>

<p>
Normally, such kind of suffering is part of a slave's live. But since <<rep
_headunit>> is rather special, this could prove to be something more than
just nightmares — perhaps it is another aspect of <<their _headunit>>
preordained destiny? You could try to send a group of slavers
together with the slave eastwards to the desert. Judging by the description,
it looks like something demonic is at play, so it would be wise to bring
slavers experienced in the dark arts along.

<p>
Your slavers scoured the <<lore region_desert>> for the potential source of the
nightmares that plagued <<rep $g.fated>> — the slave's
<<if $g.fated.isHasDick()>>dick twitched<<else>>clit twitched<</if>> whenever
they were closing into the source. Using it as some sort of dowsing rod, your
slavers managed to pinpoint what appeared to be the source of the nightmare —
a large breach in a densely-misted area near an oasis.
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'success' or $gOutcome == 'critical'>>

<p>
After <<yourrep $g.wizard>> <<uadv $g.wizard>> stabilized the gate, the rest of
the team went inside the breach and into the land beyond.
As is norm for the land beyond <<lore concept_mist>>,
they were met with the most debauched of scenes. Naked bodies
of various races are on display along the fleshy walls, most had one or more
of their slave holes filled either by a demon fucking them senseless or just
with demonic tentacles that appeared out of nowhere.
Before your slavers fully got their bearing back, they were
greeted by the realm's <<lady $g.demon>>, <<if $g.demon.isHasDick()>>a buff
and ridiculously well-endowed incubus
<<else>>
a ridiculously well-endowed succubus with an hourglass figure
<</if>> who proceeded to claim a special connection with <<rep $g.fated>>.
When <<reps $g.fated>> body began to glow purple, your slavers offered the
slave (temporarily, they hope) to the <<succubus $g.fated>>. For such offer
the <<incubus $g.fated>> gladly lent some of <<their $g.fated>> toys for your
slavers to peruse, while <<they $g.fated>> worked with <<yourrep $g.fated>>.
</p>

<p>
To fulfill the aspect of envy, the <<incubus $g.fated>> first placed a cruel
chastity device covering the entirety of your slave's <<ugenital $g.fated>>.
In the coming days, <<rep $g.fated>> fated|was forced to service many,
many other <<if $g.fated.isHasDick()>>cocks, with many repeatedly came with
abandon inside <<their $g.fated>> <<umouth $g.fated>>.<<else>>pussies, plenty of whose juice
were absorbed into <<their $g.fated>> throat.<</if>> All were done without
ever allowing <<rep $g.fated>> to climax. When the slave was returned back to
your slavers, they noticed that the slave's legs had somehow been
transformed into a painful-looking pair of demonic hooves, glowing faintly purple.
</p>

<p>
The debaucheries ended, your slavers were safely returned back to the desert, to
the great relief of <<yourrep $g.wizard>> who had waited <<uadv $g.wizard>> in
the desert for days, all while keeping the breach stable.
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>

<p>
Your slavers <<uadv $g.trainer>> managed to stole some treasure from the land
beyond <<lore concept_mist>>, which fetched for a good price.
</p>

<</if>>

<<else>>

<p>
After <<rep $g.wizard>> <<uadv $g.wizard>> attempted to stabilizes the gate,
the rest of the team went inside into the breach. But <<reps $g.wizard>>
stabilization was messy, and a massive corrupted blowback repelled your slavers
and your slave back into the mortal plane. While they sustained no injuries,
the demonic blowback had corrupted parts of their bodies.
