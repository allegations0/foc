<p>
Recently, you have read in your library about the "Trial of Wrath" — which
requires its participant to join and survive the initiation rite of the
orcish tribe. Hearing this, you can't help but wonder if this trial is one of
the challenges that <<yourrep _headunit>> must overcome to fulfill <<their
_headunit>> destiny.
</p>

<p>
It would be impossible to subject <<rep _headunit>> directly to the rite, for the rite
is only done for new prospective members of the orcish tribe. But perhaps you can ask
some of the tribes on how the rite is actually done, which can help you perform the
rite on the slave. You can try to send a group of slavers over to the desert
to find relatively unwrathful orc encampment, and see what they can find there.
</p>

<p>
Your slavers managed to find one small orcish encampment who mostly lives off
trading. <<Yourrep $g.pimp>> managed to <<uadv $g.pimp>> represent your team well
— effectively acting as <<reps $g.fated>> pimp. Once inside, <<rep $g.fated>> fated|was
immediately rented by some of the orcs, while <<rep $g.guard>> busily search
for relevant information. They gathered much information about the rite,
including all the spanking and whipping that surprisingly comes with it.
</p>

<p>
In fact, one of the orcs had just come to age, and would be
subjected to the rite later that night. Your slavers were invited to watch,
which they gladly agreed. That night, your slavers watched as the new orc
member was chained to a post and then whipped and flogged by their fellow
orcs — you could not help but notice that the orc's
<<if $g.orc.isHasDick()>>dick<<else>>pussy<</if>> remains <<wet $g.orc>> all that time.
That looked simple enough, so your slavers eagerly tried this out on <<rep
$g.fated>> on the spot. They tied <<therace $g.fated>> on a tree, and synchronised their whipping and
spanking with the ritual — soon enough, <<rep $g.fated>> started to glow red
and tusks formed around <<their $g.fated>> mouth. By the end of the
ritual, the red glow faded, and <<reps $g.fated>> entire body was red from
the whipping. <<They $g.fated>> sported new orcish tusks jutting out of
their mouth, surely signifying the success of the ritual.
</p>

<p>
The next day, your slavers bid farewell to the nice orcs while
<<yourrep $g.pimp>> <<uadv $g.pimp>> collected the money obtained from whoring <<rep $g.fated>> out.

<p>
Unfortunately, your slavers were not able to find a particularly friendly
orcish encampment. When your slavers tried to insist on one of the
encampments, the guards attacked your slavers, leaving them a little injured.
</p>


:: Quest_the_seven_deadly_transformation__wrathDisaster [nobr]
<p>
When your slavers attempted to parlay with the guards of one of the orcish
encampment, they were ambushed by orcish ambusher who lied in wait precisely
for such travelers. Your
slavers somehow managed to escape from the situation, albeit sustaining heavy
injuries.
