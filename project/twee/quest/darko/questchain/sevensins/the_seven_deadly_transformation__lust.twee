<p>
A letter arrived at your company from the <<lore location_npc>> (NPC) in the
<<lore region_forest>>. Apparently, one of your slaves, <<rep _headunit>>, has an
upcoming booking for one of the most famous whorehouses in NPC, the <<lore
location_purrloin>>.
</p>

<p>
Recalling <<reps _headunit>> supposed grand destiny, this could be one of the
trials that <<they _headunit>> has to face. But really? A whorehouse? Well,
might as well enjoy it then and send a group of lucky slavers proficient in the art of
whoring. At the very least, your slavers will have their fun, if this turns
out to be nothing but dead lead.
</p>

<p>
Your slavers arrived the <<lore location_purrloin>> — immediately several
slutty neko threw themselves on the floor and writhed for your slavers'
attention, a normal greeting for the upstanding location.
But they were here on a mission... kinda, of uh... what mission
again?
</p>

<p>
The hostess, seeing your slavers' valid reservation for the place, escorted them
to one of the private rooms. There,
four sexy neko were strewn around in the bed, <<if $g.whore.isHasDick()>>all
with stiff pricks<<else>>all with wet pussies<</if>> ready for whatever their
clients desired.
</p>

<p>
Initially, they let <<rep $g.fated>> played with the four neko toys
available in the room. But <<rep $g.fated>> did not seem to be overly
enthusiastic by the idea and nothing seemed to happen.
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'failure' or $gOutcome == 'disaster'>>

<p>
Disappointed, your slavers turned to leave the establishment without perusing
any of the wares.
<<if $gOutcome == 'failure'>>
The hostess saw the dissatisfaction in your slavers, and
assumed the worst. <<They $g.whore>> promised to send another invitation to your company,
with compliments of course.
Well, at least this means you can try again for free some time later.
<<else>>
Before leaving, they made another appointment so you could try again —- albeit
having to pay quite a large sum of money for it.
<</if>>
</p>

<<else>>

<p>
Frustrated, your
slavers decided to <<uadv $g.trainer>> unleashed their frustrations by joining
in the orgy —
The mission was soon forgotten as
they made <<rep $g.fated>> join the neko as the fifth orgy slave. Your
slavers proceeded to use all five slaves with abandon. For a few hours the room
— locked tight — were filled with nothing but hard rough sex and aroused moans
coming from both the slaves and the slavers. Your slavers never noticed when or how,
but by the end of the orgy, <<rep $g.fated>> sported a new pair of
neko eyes — rewarding the slave for such a debauched servicing of <<their
$g.fated>> betters.
</p>

<p>
Having fully exhausted the slaves, your slavers spent a few more hours
recuperating before collaring <<rep $g.fated>> back for a long journey home,
successful in the journey worthy of being called the trial of love.
