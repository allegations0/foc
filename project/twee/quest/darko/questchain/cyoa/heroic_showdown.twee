<p>
The pair of
<<= $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_lovers')>>
have once again came to your fort, but this time, it is with grim
determination to end their journey once and for all.
Within the <<lore region_desert>>, they have located a breach in <<lore concept_mist>> where
they are certain that the demon must be waiting for them there.
<<if $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_revenge') == 'revenge'>>
The time has come for them to exact their revenge.
<<else>>
The time has come for them to end the tragedy once and for all.
<</if>>
But they are not foolish enough to go alone — they are approaching your
company to ask for a backup help, and promises great reward.
</p>

<p>
Fighting demons won't be easy, but fortunately you had plenty of time to
prepare thanks to the book. The finale of the story is finally here, and it
is up to you to help close the chapter.
</p>


:: Quest_heroic_showdownCrit [nobr]

<p>
Your slavers journeyed with the 
<<= $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_lovers')>>
for several days until finally they got very close to their destination.
After resting peacefully in
<<if $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_oasis') == 'oasis'>>
an oasis,
<<else>>
a desert caverns,
<</if>>
your slavers arrived with the
<<= $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_lovers')>>
together at the site, a crater with dark cloud and lightning looming over the
place. It looked ominous and foreboding — a clear indicator that your slavers
were in the right place.
Led by the
<<= $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_lovers')>>,
<<rep $g.tank>> <<uadv $g.tank>> and your band of slavers ran down towards the crater
<<if $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_caution') == 'caution'>>
  cautiously.
<<else>>
  courageously.
<</if>>
</p>

<p>
Their descend were not peaceful, as demonic creatures suddenly appeared out of
nowhere and start attacking them.
<<Rep $g.tank>> <<uadv $g.tank>> protected <<their $g.tank>> team members
while <<rep $g.dps>> <<uadv $g.dps>> dispatched a creature, and then two, and more.
Meanwhile, the <<= $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_lovers')>>
<<if $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_lovers') == 'rivals'>>
each fought on their own, turning the battle into a competition of who could dispatch the most.
<<else>>
fought with their backs on each other, fighting not as two people, but as one.
<</if>>
</p>

<p>
After the fierce fight, your slavers and the
<<= $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_lovers')>>
arrived at the center of the crater, where a sizable rift awaits. It was then
that they heard footsteps coming from the beyond, and before long <<if
$g.demon.isFemale()>>a naked and incredibly voluptuous succubus<<else>>a
naked and extremely well hung incubus<</if>> walked out of the portal
seemingly with no care in the world.
</p>

<p>
Upon seeing the demon,
<<if $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_revenge') == 'revenge'>>
your slavers could see vindictive rage and anger burning in the
<<= $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_lovers')>>' eyes,
<<else>>
your slavers could see decisive resolution in the faces of the
<<= $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_lovers')>>,
<</if>>
knowing their journey was at an end.
<<if $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_strength') == 'strength'>>
Raising their sword,
<<else>>
Casting their spell,
<</if>>
they immediately attacked the demon, who swatted the
<<if $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_strength') == 'strength'>>
weapon
<<else>>
spell
<</if>>
seemingly with no problem at all.
<<if $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_revenge') == 'revenge'>>
Crying a battle cry,
<<else>>
Vowing solemnly,
<</if>>
the <<= $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_lovers')>>
began their attack in the fullest,
while your slavers fought off the demonic minions that keep appearing out of
nowhere around the craters.
</p>

<p>
The fight was long and bloody, but by pure chance a stray spell hit the demon,
stunning <<them $g.demon>> for a while. That short time was all the time
needed for <<name $g.hero1>> and <<name $g.hero2>> to
simultaneously
<<if $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_strength') == 'strength'>>
impale their weapons into the demon, dispatching <<them $g.demon>>.
<<else>>
impale the demon with a magical spear, dispatching <<them $g.demon>>.
<</if>>
The demon turned to dust, and
as if acknowledging that the fight was over,
the sky suddenly cleared up, and the demonic minions retreated from the fight.
</p>

<p>
Having their duties over, the
<<= $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_lovers')>>
stood silently over the demon corpse, unmoving, seemingly thinking
about all the adventures they had up to and leading into this end.
Meanwhile, your slavers gathered the pay they were promised. Not wanting to disturb the
<<= $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_lovers')>>,
they left without saying goodbye and headed home to your fort.
The pair of <<= $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_lovers')>> never once looked back at your slavers.
</p>

<p>
Your slavers never noticed that the demon taunted the
<<= $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_lovers')>>
during the fight, shaking their convictions to the core.
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'success'>>
<p>Your slavers sustained minor injuries during the terrible fight.</p>
<<elseif $gOutcome == 'failure'>>
<p>Your slavers sustained great injuries during the corrupted fight.</p>
<<elseif $gOutcome == 'disaster'>>
<p>Your slavers barely made it out of the fight, and they were corrupted much from the intense fight.</p>
<</if>>
