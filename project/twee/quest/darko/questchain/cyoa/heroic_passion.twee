<p>
Having seemingly finished with their training in the forests,
the pair of
<<= $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_siblings')>>
<<name $g.hero1>> and <<name $g.hero2>>
once again arrives at your fort's doorsteps. During their training, they
managed to find the source of their village's demise â€” a demonic lord
who loves nothing but to toy with humans. To
<<if $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_revenge') == 'revenge'>>
exact their revenge,
<<else>>
make sure the tragedy never happen again to anyone,
<</if>>
they are planning to brave the dangers of the <<lore region_desert>>. But first,
they need good equipments from the <<lore region_city>>.
</p>

<p>
They are hoping to borrow a couple of your people to help them find and
appraise the various equipments on sale in the city.
Again, your slavers are promised rewards for helping them.
</p>

<p>
After appearing three times in a row,
this cannot be coincidence yet again. To make absolutely sure that this
is related to that "Choose Your Own Adventure" magical book you've been perusing of late,
you should ask the slavers you send on this quest to also check whether the pair of <<=
$varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_siblings')>>
<<if $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_lovers') == 'lovers'>>
are actually lovers now.
<<elseif $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_lovers') == 'rivals'>>
are actually rivals now.
<<else>>
have formed deep friendship with each other.
<</if>>
</p>

<p>
Your slavers met the
<<= $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_siblings')>> at the outskirts of the village.
They looked quite different now that they have finished their training ---
<<if $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_strength') == 'strength'>>
with muscles around their body
<<else>>
with a magical aura surrounding their body
<</if>>
and a matching pendant -- a gift from the sage to watch over them.
Your slavers and the
<<= $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_siblings')>>
spent days in the city, browsing through the various equipments on sale.
<<if $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_strength') == 'strength'>>
Swords, axes, lances, plate armors, all sort of equipment to protect a fighter's body.
<<else>>
Wands, robes, hats, all sort of equipments to enhance one's mind.
<</if>>
Amidst the slew of low-quality items, <<rep $g.appraiser1>> <<uadv
$g.appraiser1>> found good quality items hidden
beneath the sea of junk.
Your slavers even got something for your own company.
In the end, your slavers were paid the money they were promised by the
ecstatic
<<= $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_siblings')>>.
</p>

<p>
Per your order, during the time they spend in the city inn, they often sneaked into the
<<= $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_siblings')>>'s
room and tried to see what raunchy things was happening inside.
<<if $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_lovers') == 'lovers'>>
Indeed, they often saw the two
<<= $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_siblings')>>
compassionately kissing each other with abandon.
Over the next few days, your slaver continued "per your orders" to watch over them,
enjoying the sight of the
<<= $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_siblings')>>
exploring the world of sex with the help of each other's naked body.
<<elseif $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_lovers') == 'rivals'>>
Whenever they peeked inside, they often see the two arguing against each
other, and trying to prove to each other that they was the better
<<if $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_strength') == 'strength'>>
fighter.
<<else>>
wizard.
<</if>>
Over the time they spent in the city, your slavers were convinced that the
<<= $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_siblings')>>
have now considered each other their true rivals, just like you predicted.
<<else>>
Whenever they peeked inside, they see the two
<<= $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_siblings')>>
compassionately talking with each
other, just like best friends.
Over the time they spent in the city, your slavers were convinced that the
<<= $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_siblings')>>
have gained each other's full trust, just like you predicted.
<</if>>
</p>


:: Quest_heroic_passionFailure [nobr]
<p>
The market was flooded with junk of various kinds, and your slavers were
unable to find any equipment worth using in the sea of junk. They were too
busy searching for wares to check whether the
<<= $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_siblings')>>
were actually
<<= $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_lovers')>>
now.
</p>


:: Quest_heroic_passionDisaster [nobr]
<p>
Your slavers got scammed by an unscrupulous merchant who sold fake weapons
that were repainted to look brand new.
They paid a great sum of money for the fake weapons, and only after they were
outside the city did they realized their mistake.
The
<<= $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_siblings')>>
understandably demanded their money back for such a sloppy job.
