<p>
The demonic book of "Choose Your Own Adventure" has quite a few characters.
First, there are the
<<= $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_lovers')>>, whose tale the book describes in great detail.
An then, there's you, who is making changes to the book and ending up as the villain.
But then, there's the sage, somehow just living quietly off in the forests.
</p>

<p>
Recalling the story, it was during their training with the sage that the
<<= $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_lovers')>>
had their vision of the demon in the desert.
Did the sage tampered with their memory?
Who is the sage?
</p>

<p>
You can send a group of slavers together with the book back into the forest
to demand answerso to these questions... but beware. It is going to be incredibly
dangerous.
</p>


:: Quest_what_it_means_to_be_a_heroCrit [nobr]

<p>
Arriving at the sage's cottage, your slavers were surprised to find the
<<= $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_lovers')>>
there too, with their
<<if $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_strength')>>
sword
<<else>>
staff
<</if>>
pointed at the sage.
Seeing your arrival, the sage finally dropped all pretense and morphed into
<<their $g.demon>> true form â€” a true pureblooded demon. A dark blast swooshed
around the area, pushing your slavers and the
<<= $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_lovers')>>
to the ground.
</p>

<p>
Apparently, the entire scene was all for the demon's amusement. The book? A
morphed necronomicon with <<their $g.demon>> own sloppy handwritten note on
it. The demon watched over all the action unfold through the pendants given
to the
<<= $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_lovers')>>
<<if $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_lovers') == 'lovers'>>
including all the
sexy actions between the
<<= $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_siblings')>>.
<</if>>
Seeing no point in fighting your slavers, the demon attempted to flee the scene.
</p>

<p>
The once pristine grove was turned into a dessicated field of rotten flowers.
But the dead trees prove quite a hindrance for the demon as <<they $g.demon>>
demon|was unable to fly away as freely as <<they $g.demon>> wanted to.
Seeing the opportunity,
<<= $g.hero1.getName()>>
<<if $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_caution') == 'caution'>>
cautiously
<<else>>
bravely<</if>>
<<if $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_strength')>>
notched an arrow
<<else>>
hurled a spell
<</if>>
onto the wings of the demons.
Angered, the demons turned instead to face the
<<= $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_lovers')>>
as they stood preparedly.
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
<p>
Your slavers fought valiantly throughout the fight, deftly avoiding most
lethal and non-lethal blows.
</p>
<<elseif $gOutcome == 'success'>>
<p>
Your slavers suffered minor injuries throughout the fight, with <<rep
$g.warrior>> being corrupted by the demon forces while <<uadv $g.warrior>>
protecting <<their $g.warrior>> allies.
</p>
<<elseif $gOutcome == 'failure'>>
<p>
Your slavers suffered major injuries throughout the fight, with <<rep
$g.warrior>> being significantly corrupted by the forces while <<uadv
$g.warrior>> protecting <<their $g.warrior>> allies.
</p>
<</if>>

<p>
The fight was intense, as the demon hurled <<lore magic_dark>> of various
kinds into your slavers and the
<<= $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_lovers')>>.
But, fueled by their
<<if $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_revenge') == 'revenge'>>
anger,
<<else>>
resolve,
<</if>>
after a fierce fight and in no small part thanks to your slavers' bravery,
the
<<= $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_lovers')>>
and your slavers emerged victorious with the demon
collapsed to the ground, unused to the workings of the mortal world.
As the
<<= $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_lovers')>>
attempted to kill the demon, your slavers asked the
<<= $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_lovers')>>
to instead take
"pity" on the demon. Your slavers <<uadv $g.tank>> promised them that your
slavers will ensure that they will never see the demon ever again.
</p>

<p>
<<if $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_revenge') == 'revenge'>>
Their quest for revenge would be incomplete for as long as the demon lives.
<<else>>
Their quest for peace could not be over for as long as the demon lives.
<</if>>
But they still deferred somewhat to your slavers, whose company had been
their most trustworthy allies thus far. But they asked you now to make a choice,
the final choice in this story.
</p>

<p>
If you kill the demon, they shall join offer their services and join your company.
</p>

<p>
If you spare the demon, they shall leave the region, never to be seen again by your company.
</p>

<p>
What will you choose?
</p>

<p>
Arriving at the sage's cottage, your slavers were surprised to find the
<<= $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_lovers')>>
there too. But your slavers appeared too late, and the sage had somehow convinced the
<<= $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_lovers')>>
that your company was the true mastermind of all the tragedies after all.
With their eyes full of
<<if $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_revenge') == 'revenge'>>
hatred,
<<else>>
resolve,
<</if>>
they asked your slavers to warn you to get ready to face judgment soon.
</p>
