:: Quest_excalibur_crusade [nobr]

<p>
<<Yourrep $g.knight>> recently went on a quest to claim the divine sword
Excalibur. But somehow, after claiming the legendary sword successfully,
<<theslaver $g.knight>> suddenly turned against <<their $g.knight>> former comrades, while
denouncing all of yours and your company's evil deeds. There can only be one
explanation for this strange and out-of-character behavior of the previously
<<uadjgood $g.knight>> slaver: the Excalibur must be possessing <<theslaver $g.knight>>,
filling <<their $g.knight>> thoughts with everything good. This must be the
ultimate fate of all doomed to be the Excalibur's host, which may explain why
the sword was sealed so deep within the kingdom's coffers.
</p>

<p>
Still, something has to be done, preferably before <<rep $g.knight>> arrives
at the doorsteps of your fort and starts a rampage inside. Fortunately,
<<rep $g.knight>> knight|was left alone at an abandoned and uninhabited
island, so it will surely take <<them $g.knight>> a great deal of time to
actually reach your fort. But best to handle this problem as soon as possible.
</p>

<p>
An informer is needed to locate <<theslaver $g.knight>> within the vast network of islands
of the <<lore region_sea>>. Once <<theslaver $g.knight>> is located, the difficult part begins.
A skilled slaver, preferably experienced in fighting knights, must somehow
subdue <<therace $g.knight>>. To make this possible at all, you will also need a
wizard skilled in <<rep setup.trait.magic_dark>>, to corrupt the holy sword as
much as possible and weaken it during the fight.
</p>

<p>
<<Yourrep $g.informer>> managed to locate <<rep $g.knight>> within a secluded
island in the <<lore region_sea>>, apparently honing <<their $g.knight>> skills in
preparation for the one-sided battle in assaulting your fort. Together with
<<utheirrel $g.warrior $g.corruptor>> <<rep $g.corruptor>>, <<yourrep
$g.warrior>> set sail towards the island.
</p>

<p>
Upon reaching the island, they found <<rep $g.knight>> ready and waiting for
them, apparently gifted the knowledge by the insights of Excalibur. A fight
immediately ensued, with <<rep $g.warrior>> fighting the best <<they
$g.warrior>> could against such a legendary sword.
<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
<<rep $g.warrior>> warrior|is no slouch in fighting though, and could actually hold <<their $g.warrior>> own skillfully even against such a masterwork sword.
<<elseif $gOutcome == 'success'>>
<<rep $g.warrior>> suffered several cuts and bruises, but nothing major especially considering the stature of <<their $g.warrior>> opponent.
<<elseif $gOutcome == 'failure'>>
<<rep $g.warrior>> suffered a massive gash delivered swiftly by <<rep
$g.knight>>, seemingly with no remorse inflicting griveous wound on <<their $g.warrior>>
former <<ufriend $g.knight $g.warrior>>.
<</if>>
But in the nick of time, <<rep $g.corruptor>> finished chanting <<their
$g.corruptor>> spell of mind bending, which was targeted towards the holy sword.
The Excalibur started to glow a small shade of purple, which in turn caused
<<rep $g.knight>> to groan in pain. Seizing the opportunity, <<rep
$g.warrior>> advanced and delivered a swift blow with <<their $g.warrior>> <<uweapon $g.warrior>>,
knocking <<rep $g.knight>> out, who then released
<<their $g.knight>> grip on the sword. Your slavers quickly and wisely
separated <<theslaver $g.knight>> from the sword, before binding and gagging <<rep
$g.knight>> as an extra precaution for the long trip home.
</p>

<p>
To recoup the costs of the expedition, your slavers sold the new plate armor previously worn by <<rep $g.knight>>.
Meanwhile, the possessive sword Excalibur was placed and sealed in a secure
box your slavers wisely brought to the isle, thanks to the advise of <<yourrep
$g.informer>>. You should decide what to do with the sword and
the tied-up slaver once they get back home.
</p>


:: Quest_excalibur_crusadeDisaster [nobr]
<p>
Four weeks of search led to nothing as <<rep $g.informer>> informer|was
unable to locate or even get a slight hint on <<reps $g.knight>> whereabout.
At least none of your slavers were affected by the endeavor. Still, better
try again before <<rep $g.knight>> do something that <<they $g.knight>> will
regret.
</p>
