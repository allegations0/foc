:: Quest_the_sword_of_legends [nobr]
<p>
The Excalibur sword went missing from the coffers of <<lore region_city>>
some time ago. As the rumors said, the sword tend to show itself to a worthy
swordsman who had proven their chivalry, experience, and wisdom. Up until
now, single <<man $unit.player>> is capable of having all three, and you
dismissed the tale as a dumb tale... until now.
</p>

<p>
One of your slavers seem to somehow, either through pure luck or careful
strategizing on your side, managed to acquire all three aspects:
<<rep setup.title.aspect_of_chivalry>>
<<rep setup.title.aspect_of_wisdom>>
<<rep setup.title.aspect_of_experience>>.
If the legends are believed to be even remotely true, it might be possible to
retrieve the sword, either for your own perusal or to be returned to the
kingdom in exchange for surely a great amount of wealth...
</p>

<<set _u = setup.getAnySlaver()>>

<p>
The journey south will be long and difficult, and <<yourrep _u>> suggested to
bring along the following team.
You will need a good navigator to navigate through the treacherous waters,
and a diviner to help divine the location of the sword. If your slavers
somehow managed to arrive at the supposed location, the knight must then show
their worth and pick up the sword, who will then judge whether the knight is
worthy.

<<questimage 'the_sword_of_legends.jpg'>>

<p>
<<Yourrep $g.navigator>> skillfully navigated the ship through the
treacherous waters, following <<reps $g.diviner>> <<uadv $g.diviner>>-delivered
divinations on the supposed location of the sword.
<<if $g.diviner.isHasTrait('magic_light_master')>>
Thankfully, <<reps $g.diviner>> mastery of <<rep setup.trait.magic_light_master>>
was enough to guide the ship safely until they arrive at
<<else>>
<<rep $g.diviner>> only had basic mastery of the domain of light, and the
ship was rocked quite severely throughout the journey, lightly injuring her
passengers. Thankfully, your slavers still managed to finally arrive at
<<run $hospital.injureUnit($g.diviner, 3)>>
<<run $hospital.injureUnit($g.navigator, 3)>>
<</if>>
an uncharted island, the supposed destination of their journey.
</p>

<p>
The island itself proved to be a challenge — filled to the brim with monsters,
<<yourrep $g.knight>> had to fight like a champion of legend through the
horde of monsters, while <<rep $g.diviner>> did <<their $g.diviner>> best
supporting with <<their $g.diviner>> <<lore magic_light>>. Finally, your
slavers arrived at the center of the island.
</p>

<p>
Therein lied a single sword shining so brightly stabbed deep down into the earth.
The light blinded both <<rep $g.diviner>> and <<rep $g.navigator>>, for it
judged them unworthy of the simple act of laying their eyes upon the divine sword Excalibur.
But it seemingly had no effect on <<yourrep $g.knight>>, who walked calmly towards the sword
before <<uadv $g.knight>> gripping it.
With a <<uadjper $g.knight>> roar, <<rep $g.knight>> attempted to hoist the sword to the sky.
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit' || $gOutcome == 'success'>>

<p>
The sword of legends, Excalibur, gently lifted from the earth and comfortably
settled in <<reps $g.knight>> <<uhands $g.knight>>.
The blinding light ended too, and as <<rep $g.navigator>> about to <<uadv
$g.navigator>> congratulate <<rep $g.knight>>, <<therace $g.knight>>
suddenly pointed the sword against <<their $g.knight>> former allies.
Denouncing all sorts of evils your company had done, <<rep $g.knight>>
suddenly attacked the rest of your slavers, eventually forcing them to
retreat back to the ship with neither <<rep $g.knight>> nor the sword in tow.
<<if $gOutcome == 'success'>>
They suffered several gashes from the skillful assault from <<rep $g.knight>>.
<</if>>
</p>

<p>
Out in the sea, your slavers were finally safe from whatever possessed <<rep
$g.knight>>. But you just know that this will not be the last time you hear of <<rep
$g.knight>>, the current divine wielder of Excalibur...
</p>

<<elseif $gOutcome == 'failure'>>

<p>
But the sword refused to move. No matter from which angle <<rep $g.knight>>
tried to lift the sword, <<they $g.knight>> felt as if the sword and the earth fused into
one. Frustrated, <<rep $g.knight>> vented their anger by slamming the sword
with their fists — a grave mistake as the sword absorbed one of the three
aspects of chivalry from <<rep $g.knight>> into the sword. Without all three
aspects of chivalries, <<rep $g.knight>> knight|was no longer immune to the
blinding light of the sword, and together with the rest of your slavers were
forced to retreat from the abode.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps you can try again if you have the chance.
</p>
<</if>>


:: Quest_the_sword_of_legendsDisaster [nobr]

<p>
<<Yourrep $g.navigator>> skillfully navigated the ship through the
treacherous waters, following <<reps $g.diviner>> <<uadv $g.diviner>>-delivered
divinations on the supposed location of the sword.
</p>

<p>
But their journey was not meant to be completed, as they were ambushed midway
by pirates. While normally these pirates were no match for your slavers' prowess,
especially <<yourrep $g.knight>>, somehow the nature itself was fighting
against you. The wind blew against your slaver's directions, and just when
your slavers seemingly about to deliver an important strike, lightning
appeared out of nowhere zapping the tip of
<<reps $g.knight>> <<uweapon $g.knight>>, shocking <<theslaver $g.knight>> to the core.
While your slavers managed to get away from the engagement intact, they
suffered great injuries as a result.
</p>

<p>
Having <<their $g.knight>> destiny stolen from right before <<their
$g.knight>> nose, <<rep $g.knight>> <<uadv $g.knight>> vented <<their
$g.knight>> anger on <<rep $g.diviner>>. But such a behavior was unsuitable
for the future wielder of Excalibur, and when your slavers returned, you can
feel that <<rep $g.knight>> knight|is no longer suitable for the task.
</p>
