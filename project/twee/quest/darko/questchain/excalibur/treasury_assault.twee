:: Quest_treasury_assault [nobr]

<p>
The Castle of Lucgate stands in the center of the magnificent city, towering
over all the other structures. While the castle itself is a magnificent
building, you are most interested in its treasury. It is said that great
riches and valuable treasures are kept there, although it is surely going to
be heavily guarded.
</p>

<p>
It would normally be impossible for your slavers to infiltrate the heavily
guarded treasury.
<<set _u = setup.getAnySlaver()>>
However, <<yourrep _u>>
<<uadv _u>> informed you that an unknown master thief is going to attempt a
heist soon. It might then be possible for your slavers to steal some of the
treasury items while the guards are distracted by the master thief, if the
rumors prove true...
</p>

<p>
You will need to send a seducer, to keep the remaining guards distracted, and two infiltrators to
sneak into the treasure and steal whatever nearby items they could get their
grubby hands on. Rumors said that the treasury is abound with traps, so
better make sure one of them is adept at disarming traps. Truly a by-the-book
approach to thievery!
</p>


:: Quest_treasury_assaultCrit [nobr]

<p>
At the supposed date of the heist, donning their best camouflage, your
slavers waited near one of the palisades of the castle.
After hours of waiting, a shouting was heard from the other side of the
castle. It seemed your slaver picked the right position, as guards from the
area they were in rushed to reinforce the other side of the castle. <<Rep
$g.seducer>> swayed their <<ubody $g.seducer>> sensuously towards the
few remaining guards, confusing the poor soldiers who are sure to get their pay
deducted once the rest of your slavers finished their business here.
</p>

<p>
Using the distraction and the commotion, <<rep $g.thief>> and <<utheirrel
$g.thief $g.disarmer>> <<rep $g.disarmer>> sneaked into the treasury.
<<if $g.disarmer.isHasTrait('per_attentive')>>
Using their perceptiveness,
<<else>>
Slowly,
<</if>>
<<rep $g.disarmer>> spotted and disarmed the numerous traps littering the place one by
one as they advanced slowly within the treasury.

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
<<Yourrep $g.thief>> <<uadv $g.thief>> spotted a hidden door in one of the
corridors, which your slavers proceeded to enter.
Behind the door, a wealth of rare equipments were scattered on the ground,
but that's not what was grabbing your slaver's attention.
Suspended in the air in the middle of a room was a naked slave, fully bound
and hung like a chandelier.
<<if $g.treasure.isHasDick()>>
<<Their $g.treasure>> dick was forced continuously hard by the tight cock ring <<they
$g.treasure>> treasure|was forced to wear, while
<<else>>
<<Their $g.treasure>> breasts were pointing downwards, weighted by heavy-looking balls attached to the nipples, while
<</if>>
<<their $g.treasure>> <<umouth $g.treasure>> was forced open with a ring gag, in
which was inserted a formidable-looking inwards-facing dildo.
But what was most impressive of all was that your slavers could see that the slave
remained sane despite all these torture â€” truly a remarkable species of a
properly-trained furniture slave. After grabbing a few of the scattered
equipments, <<rep $g.thief>> undid the slave's binding just enough to get
<<them $g.treasure>> off the ceiling, but not enough to let <<them
$g.treasure>> do any meaningful struggles.
<<if $g.treasure.isHasDick()>>
<<Rep $g.disarmer>> playfully teased the slave's hard <<udick $g.treasure>>
while they escaped from the treasury with their treasures.
<<else>>
According to <<rep $g.disarmer>>, there was no time to undo the slave's
nipple weights and so the slave had to endure the weights bouncing left and
right, pulling <<their $g.treasure>> nipples painfully as your slavers escaped
the treasury with their treasures.
<</if>>
<<else>>
Not wanting to take any risks, your slavers entered the first room they
encountered. A host of equipments laid in the room for your slavers' taking.
Choosing the best ones, your slavers escaped the treasury quickly before the
rest of the guards were alarmed by their presence.
<</if>>
</p>

<p>
Once outside, <<rep $g.thief>> <<uadv $g.thief>> signaled the completion of the heist to <<rep
$g.seducer>>, who was still busy distracting the guards by seductively pointing to <<their
$g.seducer>> <<ugenital $g.seducer>>. Safe and sound, your slavers returned
back home with their treasures.
</p>

<p>
Rumors said that the master thief's heist was successful, although the
<<rep $company.humankingdom>> denies all accounts of a breach to their most guarded treasury...
</p>


:: Quest_treasury_assaultFailure [nobr]

<p>
At the supposed date of the heist, donning their best camouflage, your
slavers waited near one of the palisades of the castle.
After hours and hours of waiting, the supposed heist never seemed to occur.
Tired of waiting, <<rep $g.disarmer>> <<uadv $g.disarmer>>
<<if $g.disarmer.getSpeech() != setup.speech.friendly>>
asked
<<else>>
ordered
<</if>>
<<rep $g.seducer>> to distract the guards.
<<Rep $g.seducer>> did <<their $g.seducer>> best to distract the guards, but
there were just too many of them.
</p>

<p>
<<if $gOutcome == 'failure'>>
<<Reps $g.disarmer>> sneaking attempt were unsuccessful as a guard was apparently not
seduced and was alarmed by <<their $g.disarmer>> presence.
While attempting to escape, <<rep $g.disarmer>> triggered one of the
treasury's traps and a hornet nest fell straight on <<their $g.disarmer>> head,
covering <<their $g.disarmer>> head and stopping <<them $g.disarmer>> dead in <<their $g.disarmer>> tracks.
With no way to help <<therace $g.disarmer>>,
the other slavers decided to escape the place without the reckless slaver.
<<urescuenow $g.disarmer>>.
<<else>>
<<Rep $g.disarmer>> and <<rep $g.thief>> managed to sneak into the treasury by using the distraction,
but <<rep $g.seducer>> seducer|was simply unable to seduce all one hundred plus of the
guards guarding the treasury. <<Rep $g.disarmer>> and <<rep $g.thief>> were
trapped inside the vaults, with no way to escape as the guards continued their patrol around
the area. There was no other choice but for <<rep $g.seducer>> to reluctantly
abandon <<their $g.seducer>> teammates and returned to your fort alone.
Still, <<rep $g.seducer>> managed to find some information should you with to rescue your reckless slavers.
<</if>>
