:: Quest_library_of_wisdomglade [nobr]

<p>
The elven race is known for both their beauty and their keen mind. Both
traits are apparently mainly attributed to their ancestors, who spent
centuries practicing magic to enhance both their wit and their physical perfection.
</p>

<<set _u = setup.getAnySlaver()>>

<p>
You have heard information that an ancient elven library lies somewhere in
the <<lore region_forest>>, apparently remaining untouched for centuries. That
certainly does not bode well for your company's chance to find it,
but rumors say that the library will
open itself for any adventurer who thirsts for knowledge. If you think you
have any such adventurer, you could try to risk it and let a group of slavers
spend an entire month in the western forests, looking for this mythical
place. Why, <<yourrep _u>> thinks it's a very good idea, if anything else!
</p>

<p>
A good scout is always required in the <<lore region_forest>> or else you risk your
slavers getting lost in the vast landscape. A scholar is also good to have,
considering it's a library you're looking for and it's most likely protected
by some sort of elven puzzle. Finally and most importantly, a true paragon of
wisdom — a knight with a particular hunger for knowledge.
</p>


:: Quest_library_of_wisdomgladeCrit [nobr]

<p>
After weeks searching and exploring the <<lore region_forest>>, their perseverance
was rewarded when <<rep $g.scout>> found an empty clearing in the middle of
the forest, with ruins scattered all about. After scrutinizing the inscriptions on
the walls, <<rep $g.scholar>> scholar|was confident that this must be the
elven library complex they were looking for. Only, there did not seem to be
anything there but a large, empty space.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to <<reps $g.scholar>> vast knowledge, <<they $g.scholar>> scholar|was
able to decipher the elven writings scattered throughout the area. Apparently,
the entire area forms an otherworldly portal, which opens the gateway into
the library. Normally, one would need to offer a sacrificial slave to open
the gate — which would be easy for your company to do, except that the slave
must be bathed for one month straight in a water distilled from seven
different types of flowers, including one already extinct.
Thankfully, there is another simpler way — a paragon of wisdom simply must
bear the risk and stand within the portal while chanting some elven gibberish.
</p>

<p>
As <<rep $g.knight>> <<uadv $g.knight>> prepared <<themself $g.knight>> for
the ritual, <<rep $g.scout>> and <<rep $g.scholar>> scoured the area for any
extra information they can get their <<uhands $g.scout>> on. The preparations complete (or
as complete as it could be), <<rep $g.knight>> stood at the center of the
area, chanting from a hastily written script.
</p>

<<if $g.knight.isHasTrait('per_slow') ||
$g.knight.isHasTrait('per_stubborn') ||
$g.knight.isHasTrait('magic_wind')>>
<p>
<<if $g.knight.isHasTrait('per_slow')>>
Halfway through however, the script became much more complex. Unfortunately
<<yourrep $g.knight>> knight|was simply too dumb to be able to finish
the chant.
<<elseif $g.knight.isHasTrait('per_stubborn')>>
Halfway through however, the script started to magically sway and move,
putting blank spaces here and there apparently as a test for your slaver's wit. But the
stubborn slaver <<rep $g.knight>> lacked the inquisitive mind required to
solve such a puzzle.
<<elseif $g.knight.isHasTrait('magic_wind')>>
Halfway through however, <<reps $g.knight>> <<rep setup.trait.magic_wind>>
magic suddenly blared out of control — the magic scattered <<their
$g.knight>> notes to the wind. This must be an old enchantment of the elves
to ward against their enemies of the past, the wielders of <<lore
magic_wind>>. Without the notes,
<</if>>
<<reps $g.knight>> reading speed slowed down to a crawl, even with <<reps
$g.scholar>> helpful notes annotated the script all over the place. Ultimately, it was
obvious that the ritual failed. At least none of your slavers were harmed by
this adventure.
</p>

<p>
Your slavers were able to scavenge some ancient elven valuables from the
ritual site, so the quest was not a complete loss.
<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
They even managed to find an ancient elven <<rep
setup.item.f_lighting_good>>, which will certainly fetch for a good price.
<</if>>
If you still desire that wisdom, perhaps you can try again with a more...
suitable slaver some other time.
</p>

<<else>>

<p>
The chanting itself turned out to be a puzzle in itself. As <<rep $g.knight>>
continued to chant, the script itself changed and twisted, demanding answers
from <<reps $g.knight>> sharp mind.
As the first challenge, the phrases became harder and intricate.
<<set _wins = 0>>
<<if $g.knight.isHasTrait('per_smart')>>
<<set _wins = _wins + 1>>
While it would have certainly stifled any other <<man $g.knight>>, it was not a
problem at all for <<rep $g.knight>>, thanks to <<their $g.knight>> brilliant
mind.
<<else>>
It greatly challenged <<reps $g.knight>> ordinary mind, but <<rep $g.knight>>
knight|was not dumb and <<they $g.knight>> knight|was able to continue no
small part due to the helpful hints that <<rep $g.scholar>> wrote on the
script.
<</if>>
But it was far from the only challenge. The words started to disappear next,
forcing <<rep $g.knight>> to improvise on the spot.
<<if $g.knight.isHasTrait('skill_creative')>>
Luckily, creativity is perhaps <<reps $g.knight>> biggest virtue, and <<they
$g.knight>> knight|was able to pass the test with complete ease.
<<elseif $g.knight.isHasTrait('per_curious')>>
Fortunately, it was not a problem at all for the inquisitive slaver, who
improvised seemingly with great ease and familiarity.
<<else>>
This greatly challenged <<rep $g.knight>>, but since <<they $g.knight>>
knight|was not a stubborn slaver, <<rep $g.knight>> managed to overcome the
challenge still.
<</if>>
Finally, a failsafe mechanism was initiated where <<reps $g.knight>> magical
prowess was tested.
<<if $g.knight.isHasTrait('magic_earth')>>
The earth immediately rose around <<rep $g.knight>>. Sensing the familiar
earth spell emanating form <<theslaver $g.knight>>, the puzzle completed its
task of verifying that the entity before them was not an enemy.
<<elseif $g.knight.isHasTrait('magic_water')>>
The sky immediately turned dark as a torrent of rain engulfed the
forests. While this had no noticable effects on the magical scripts, it
seemed that it was satisfied by the lack of <<lore magic_wind>>.
<<elseif $g.knight.isHasTrait('magic_fire')>>
The sky immediately turned crimson as fire circled <<rep $g.knight>>. While
this had no noticable effects on the magical scripts, it seemed that it was
satisfied by the lack of <<lore magic_wind>>.
<<elseif $g.knight.isHasTrait('magic_light')>>
<<Rep $g.scout>> and <<utheirrel $g.scout $g.scholar>> <<rep $g.scholar>>
watched as <<reps $g.knight>> innate <<lore magic_light>> covered <<their
$g.knight>> entire body, glowing brightly. While this had no noticable
effects on the magical scripts, it seemed that it was satisfied by the lack of
<<lore magic_wind>>.
<<elseif $g.knight.isHasTrait('magic_dark')>>
<<Rep $g.knight>> winced in pain as <<they $g.knight>> felt the corrupted
energy flew from within <<their $g.knight>> body and into the script, but seemingly with no
noticable effect. Either way, it seemed that the puzzle was satisfied by the
lack of <<lore magic_wind>>.
<<else>>
But <<rep $g.knight>> knight|was not known for <<their $g.knight>> magical
talents, and nothing happened. But it seemed that this was a passable grade for
the puzzle — perhaps it was only checking for the <<lore magic_wind>>, which
was wielded by the elf's ancient enemy?
<</if>>
</p>

<<if $g.knight.isHasTrait('per_smart') &&
$g.knight.isHasTrait('magic_earth') &&
($g.knight.isHasTrait('per_curious') || $g.knight.isHasTrait('skill_creative'))>>
<p>
<<Rep $g.knight>> passed the test with such a flying color that the script
visibly enhanced <<them $g.knight>>, bestowing <<them $g.knight>> with ancient
knowledge. <<Yourrep $g.knight>> came out wiser than ever<<if
!$g.knight.isYou()>>, perhaps even wiser than you if <<they $g.knight>>
knight|was not already before<</if>>.
</p>
<</if>>

<p>
As the trial completed, your slavers gazed in awe as the Library of
Wisdomglade that magically materialized before them, standing in the once open
space in the forests. <<Rep $g.knight>> <<uadv $g.knight>> led the rest of
the team into the library...
<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
  (Although not before looting the rare elven <<rep setup.item.f_lighting_good>> <<rep $g.scout>> spotted earlier!)
<</if>>
</p>

<</if>>

<p>
After weeks searching and exploring the <<lore region_forest>>, their perseverance
was rewarded when <<rep $g.scout>> found an empty clearing in the middle of
the forest, with ruins scattered all about. After scrutinizing the inscriptions on
the walls, <<rep $g.scholar>> scholar|was confident that this must be the
elven library complex they were looking for. Only, there did not seem to be
anything there but a large, empty space.
</p>

<p>
As your slavers scoured for more information about this mysterious place, the
<<uadjbad $g.knight>> <<urace $g.knight>> <<rep $g.knight>> found a
mysterious small circle within the clearings. <<They $g.knight>> <<uadv
$g.knight>> (but also stupidly) stepped in as if <<they $g.knight>> had no care in the
world. Apparently the ancient elven magical enchantments still held to this
very day, and the portal trap activated, teleporting <<rep $g.knight>> to a
land unknown.
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'disaster'>>
<p>
Taking it as a challenge on their skills, <<rep $g.scout>> promised
<<utheirrel $g.scout $g.scholar>> <<rep $g.scholar>> that <<they $g.scout>>
had a plan to save <<rep $g.knight>>. Before <<rep $g.scholar>> had
a time to react, however, <<rep $g.scout>> found another portal and <<uadv
$g.scout>> stepped in, teleporting yet another one of your slavers into a
faraway land. In the end, the team was left with only the <<uadjgood
$g.scholar>> <<urace $g.scholar>> left...
</p>

<p>
Several days later, you receive a letter in your office hinting on where you
could possibly rescue <<yourrep $g.knight>>. Oddly enough, it was signed
seemingly by <<rep $g.scout>>, who as you remembered was also nowhere to be
seen. <<uneedrescue $g.scout>>, before <<they $g.scout>> get <<themself
$g.scout>> into even deeper trouble.
</p>
<<else>>
<p>
Seeing as many other similar portal traps were spread around the area, your
remaining slavers wisely decided to retreat back.
<<uneedrescue $g.knight>>.
