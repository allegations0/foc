<<set _u = setup.getUnit({title: 'quest_broken_descent_0'})>>

<<if !_u>>
  <<missingunitquest>>
<<else>>
<p>
With all four mortal essence restored to the slave, the last step to awaken
the mind behind the lifeless eyes of <<yourrep _u>> is to mend whatever wound
that broke the slave before. And from your slaver's research, this wound is a
considerable one.
</p>

<p>
To attempt the awakening, three especially gifted healers must attend to the
slave for a month non-stop. Each must administer tender care to the slave to
soothe the spirit, restore joy, bring pleasure, and draw the empathy back.
<<set _score = $varstore.get('broken_wings_dark')>>
<<if _score >= 3>>
...or perhaps the opposite of it, given what you have chosen to do with the
slave thus far.
<<elseif _score <= 1>>
Oh yes, you will finally see the fruit of your labor, having chose to nurture the slave
ever so kindly thus far.
<<else>>
You will finally see the result of your ambivalence, and the slave will
awaken exactly as you specify... or not.
<</if>>
</p>

<p>
The ritual will be long and taxing for your slavers, and you best get comfortable...
</p>
<</if>>


:: Quest_broken_wingsCrit [nobr]
<p>
<<Yourrep $g.head>> <<uadv $g.head>> led the healing ritual. In a carefully
designed room, your slavers tended non-stop to the poor slave for a month,
attempting to rouse whatever spirit lying dormant inside the husk of
<<therace $g.slave>>.
</p>

<p>
By the end of the first week, the slave began to utter what appeared to be
terrible nightmares. A war between angels and demons, in the land beyond even
farther beyond <<lore concept_mist>>. The slave continued to narrate to your slavers with
great detail â€” the clashes of celestial flesh against corrupted aberrations,
and how <<their $g.slave>> comrade fell one by one until only <<they
$g.slave>> remained.
</p>

<p>
It was in the midst of battle, and seeing no escape from the enroaching demons
and from <<their $g.slave>> upcoming demise, <<they $g.slave>> felt what <<they $g.slave>>
vaguely recall as a feeling of fear. But fear was a forbidden feeling for an
angel such as <<themself $g.slave>>, and the gods bestowed punishment upon <<them
$g.slave>> mid-war by banishing <<them $g.slave>> unto the mortal plane and
stripping <<them $g.slave>> of all that made them be before scattering it across
the land.
</p>

<p>
And you had collected and restored all of the essence back. But the
former-angel change was already permanent, and <<they $g.slave>> now possesses
a normal mortal body. Your slavers continued to soothe and pray for the poor
soul, until they can see the slave's eyes lit up for the first time, full
with life.
</p>

<p>
<<set _score = $varstore.get('broken_wings_dark')>>
<<if _score >= 3>>
Given how you have decided to corrupt <<their $g.slave>> essence so very
much, there was only anger reflected behind the slave's formerly pure
mind. Anger at <<themself $g.slave>>, anger at the demons, and more
importantly at the gods for cursing <<them $g.slave>> despite <<their
$g.slave>> service. The slave proceeded to lash out at your slavers and trying to escape
from <<their $g.slave>> predicament by spreading <<their $g.slave>> newly
restored wings wide.
<<elseif _score <= 1>>
<<They $g.slave>> suddenly broke into sobs, regretting all that <<they
$g.slave>> had done, and beg for forgiveness. Trying to return to <<their
$g.slave>> god, the slave attempted an escape from your slavers, spreading
<<their $g.slave>> newly restored wings wide.
<<else>>
<<They $g.slave>> remained in the room, unmoving, seemingly confused with the
moderate changes to their personality here and there, no doubt thanks to your
decisions thus far.
Seemingly coming to a conclusion of your intentions, <<they $g.slave>> tried to
escape from your slavers, spreading <<their $g.slave>> newly restored wings
wide.
<</if>>
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, <<their $g.slave>> body is of a mortal now, and given your
slavers' wealth of experience, they were able to subdue the former-angel. More
importantly, however, the former angel's mind is now restored, and
although <<they $g.slave>> will still require some work to be a proper slave,
the training can at least begin now. As your slavers finished their reports,
you lick your lips in anticipation of breaking a particularly hardy slave...
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
<p>
It seems the ritual had also restored some semblance of divine clothings to
the former angel. But the slave wouldn't be needing them for a good long while, and your
slavers will keep these clothes and put them to better use.
</p>
<</if>>


:: Quest_broken_wingsFailure [nobr]
<p>
Unfortunately, after spending four consecutive week of tending to the slave,
<<yourrep $g.slave>>'s condition never improved past what was <<their $g.slave>>
formerly broken self. Your slavers were crushed that their tender
ministrations had no effect, and began questioning themselves.
</p>

<p>
There will surely be another chance to reattempt this quest later.
</p>
