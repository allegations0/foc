<<set _u = setup.getUnit({title: 'quest_broken_descent_0'})>>

<<set _v = setup.getAnySlaver()>>

<<if !_u>>
  <<missingunitquest>>
<<else>>
<p>
Your scouts tracked one of the missing essences of <<rep _u>> into the
<<lore location_npc>>. Specifically, they tracked the source to one of the
nameless whorehouses in the city. Apparently, one of its most "productive"
neko employees had recently just retired, after <<they $g.neko>> had a
suddenly found disgust for the profession. This may just be the lead you are
looking for...
</p>
<</if>>


:: Quest_essence_of_lustCrit [nobr]

<p>
Using <<reps $g.slave>> <<if $g.slave.isHasDick()>>dick<<else>>clit<</if>> as
a living dowsing rod, <<rep $g.dowser>> pinpointed the source of the anomaly to one of
the small houses in the city. After knocking on the door, your slavers were
greeted with a neko seemingly downtrodden on <<their $g.neko>> luck, who was
looking for a job. As <<they $g.neko>> explained, <<they $g.neko>> retired
from <<their $g.neko>> previous occupation because whoring feels wrong â€” that
a <<man $g.neko>> should only dedicate <<themself $g.neko>> to just one
person. A strange thing to say for a neko and <<their $g.neko>> clearly very
sexual culture.
</p>

<p>
Your slavers came up on the spot with a strategy: <<rep $g.convincer1>> will
try <<their $g.convincer1>> best recruiter impression while <<rep
$g.convincer2>> would scour the place for the source of this sudden change in
personality. After a while, <<rep $g.convincer2>> found a green-ish stone
stuck on the chimney of the house. It took <<them $g.convincer2>> an hour to
pull it out, before returning back to the entrance. With the stone very close
to all parties involved, all your slavers could feel the power emanating from
the stone: the power of chastity suggestion. Your slavers' minds became very
clear, and all thoughts of sex were removed almost entirely to their sides.
This must be the essence you were looking for.
</p>

<p>
With their goal achieved, <<yourrep $g.convincer1>> <<uadv
$g.convincer1>> excused <<themself $g.convincer1>>, before going back to your
fort with the stone in tow.
<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
However, it turned out that <<reps $g.convincer1>> recruiter impression was
so strong that the neko later showed up at your fort, apparently trying to
"apply" for the position offered. Well, there is always a space in your
dungeons for a willing slave!
<</if>>
</p>


:: Quest_essence_of_lustFailure [nobr]
<p>
Instead of successfully finding the source, your slavers got entirely lost in
the complex layout of the city. By the time they decided to give up and
return, they noticed their pockets were way lighter than what they had when they entered the city.
It appeared that your slavers had fallen victim to the rampant pickpocketry in the
city, and you'll have to compensate them from the company's coffers...
</p>
