<p>
One of the lush islands in the <<lore region_sea>> is home to one of the
rarest substance in the world: the <<rep
setup.item.quest_bewitchment_nectar>> that you've been looking for as part of
your revenge against the damned forest fairy.
</p>

<p>
There will surely be unknown challenges for harvesting the nectar, however,
so you'd better prepare for the worst. A biologist to harvest the nectar, and
two other slavers that are prepared for anything.
</p>


:: Quest_nectar_of_the_godsCrit [nobr]
<p>
The island was lush, to say the least. Dense vegetation covered every inch of
the island, and your slavers struggled to reach the heart of the island.
There, a lone tree stood, towering over all the other vegetations. Without
warning, vines started to sprout from the ground, as if the tree was welcoming
your slavers with the promise of penetrations.
</p>

<p>
As the vine wiggled into existence, <<yourrep $g.biologist>> recognized that
the liquid emanating from its tip was the actual <<rep
setup.item.quest_bewitchment_nectar>>. Excited at the opportunity, <<rep
$g.biologist>> attempted to gather the nectar only for another vine to
violently bursted from the ground, piercing <<their $g.biologist>> <<uanus
$g.biologist>>. By the time <<rep $g.fighter>> cut off the vine, <<reps
$g.biologist>> ass was already violated, and appeared more gaped than before.
</p>

<p>
Now fully alert, your slavers prepared for battle as <<rep $g.biologist>>
sneakily gathered the leaking plant liquid here and there. The battle was fierce,
and many vines were felled by <<reps $g.fighter>> <<uweapon $g.fighter>> while
<<rep $g.healer>> desperately tried to keep the collective damage at minimum.
Eventually <<rep $g.biologist>> managed to collect enough of the nectar, and
called out for the team to withdraw. Your slavers withdrew from battlefield,
but not before <<rep $g.fighter>> managed to snatch one of the scattered
armors on the battlefield, no doubt belonging to an unlucky adventurer who
dared ventured here in the past.
<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
<<rep $g.healer>> healer|was also able to snatch a rare <<rep
setup.item.potion_tight>>, no doubt brought by some prudent but unlucky
adventurer who must have withdrawn from the fight with a leaking ass...

$g.biologist>>.
Your other slavers were not spared either, as hundreds of tentacles started to sprout
from the ground, seeking all and any hole left open for them to pierce.
</p>

<p>
Within moments, all of your slavers were left writhing, having a vine or two inserted
into all their orifices. It lasted for a good hour or so, before your slavers
were drained of all their juices, and thrown aside. With no more willpower to
gather the nectar, your slavers crawled back onto the ship,
hoping to forget all these bad memories.
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'disaster'>>
<p>
Unfortunately,
<<if $gQuest.getSeed() % 3 == 0>>
<<rep $g.biologist>>
<<elseif $gQuest.getSeed() % 3 == 1>>
<<rep $g.fighter>>
<<elseif $gQuest.getSeed() % 3 == 2>>
<<rep $g.healer>>
<</if>>
seemed to get a little too addicted to the feeling of being violated, and became more submissive than ever...
</p>
