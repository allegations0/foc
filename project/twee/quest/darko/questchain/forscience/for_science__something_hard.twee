<p>
The second item in the <<rep setup.item.quest_for_science_list>>
is a the "Sine Prelog" fruit, somewhere in the western forests. From what you
have gathered, finding the fruit itself is not the challenge of a task — it is the harvesting
that's problematic. The details are vague, but apparently if you want the
mission to succeed, you should send a group of slavers — a wizard proficient
in <<lore magic_earth>>, a biologist to identify the fruit, and most
importantly a whore. It is unclear why you need to bring a whore, but you can
try to send a group of slavers to the western forests if you want to find out
why.

<p>
After asking around in the nearby settlements, <<rep $g.wizard>> <<uadv
$g.wizard>> claimed to the rest of the slavers that <<they $g.wizard>> had
found a way to harvest the fruit. Several ways, in fact. The ultimate
decision is yours to make, as to which method you want to use to harvest the
fruit, but <<rep $g.wizard>> warned you that none of them will be easy.

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
<p>
On the way back, <<rep $g.biologist>> found several useful plants that they
managed to sell in the nearby settlements.

<p>
During their search for information, your slavers were ambushed by a tentacle
aberration in the middle of the forests. Fortunately, the aberration seemed to
be fixated on the whore <<rep $g.offering>>. Using the distraction, <<rep
$g.wizard>> cast a powerful spell, ending the beast and freeing <<rep
$g.offering>> from its clutches. <<Rep $g.offering>> suffered some injuries,
which will take some time to heal.

<p>
During their search for information, your slavers were ambushed by a tentacle
aberration in the middle of the forests. All your slavers were bound by its
viny tentacles, and the beast took its time to explore your slaver's bodies.
Days past as your slavers' holes were inserted with larger and larger
tentacles until they all gape from severe use, before the beast decided to
discard your slavers in a nearby settlement.
