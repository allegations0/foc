:: Quest_the_rear_deal [nobr]
<p>

<<if $inventory.isHasItem(setup.item.rear_technology)>>
The rich nobleman in the <<lore region_city>> has once again asked for a
slave trained to their very
demanding specification. The promised reward this time is five bottles of
<<rep setup.item.potion_tight>>,
which you can certainly make good use of. Do you have what it takes to
complete the quest?
<<else>>
You have recently heard that a rich nobleman in the <<lore region_city>> is
in possession of an extremely rare artifact: <<rep
setup.item.rear_technology>>. This technology is said to allow
the use of the rare and elusive potion <<rep setup.item.potion_tight>>, which
can then be used to
restore the tightness a slave's rear holes at will.
Surely getting such an important and crucial technology cannot be easy,
so why does this quest appears to be so easy?

<p>
After intense negotiations, your slaver managed to drove a hard bargain â€”
<<if $inventory.isHasItem(setup.item.rear_technology)>>
five bottles of <<rep setup.item.potion_tight>>
<<else>>
<<rep setup.item.rear_technology>>
<</if>>
in exchange for a perfectly trained slave exactly to the noble's demanding
specifications. The slave must be delivered in a timely manner too, or the
entire deal is forfeit.
<<if !$g.negotiator1.isYou()>>
Once <<rep $g.negotiator1>> delivered <<their $g.negotiator1>> full report to
you, you
<<else>>
You
<</if>>
started to wonder if <<yourrep $g.slavetrainer>>
slavetrainer|have what it takes to lead such a difficult series of slave trainings...
Either way,
<<if $inventory.isHasItem(setup.item.rear_technology)>>
you better get to work if you want to get your grubby <<uhands $unit.player>> on that <<rep setup.item.potion_tight>>s.
<<else>>
the fate of this artifact is now in your <<uhands $unit.player>>.
