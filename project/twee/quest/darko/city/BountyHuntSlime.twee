<p>
The <<lore region_city>> has a massive underground sewers system.
While most of the sewers are kept functional, some deeper parts of the sewers
were apparently built in ancient times, and it is said to be inhabited by
otherworldly monsters.
One of the most infamous among these monsters are the slimes,
who is said to feed upon the bodily fluids of other creatures.
</p>

<p>
One of the alchemists in the city is posting an open request for a vial of the slime's
liquid body for <<their $g.alchemist>> research.
<<They $g.alchemist>> is offering a great amount of reward for adventurers brave enough to best
these creatures.
</p>

<<if $g.slave.isMale()>>
<<else>>
  <<questimage 'bounty_hunt_slime_female.jpg'>>
<</if>>

<p>
During their adventure below the city,
your slavers happened upon a slime "mating" with an unlucky victim,
a resident of the undercity of Lucgate.
With the slime distracted, it was easy for your slavers to defeat the creature.
As your slavers put the slime's body into the vial,
<<set _alc = setup.selectUnit([$g.merc1, $g.merc2, $g.negotiator], {trait: 'skill_alchemy'})>>
<<if _alc>>
<<yourrep _alc>> perceptively noted that a rare alchemical component was absorbed into the vial --
<<else>>
they were lucky that a rare component flew into the vial -- 
<</if>>
a mixture of its latest victim cum mixed together with the slime's natural aphrodisiac.
<<Yourrep $g.negotiator>> managed to use this rare material to
<<uadv $g.negotiator>> negotiate a better pay with
the alchemist, who happily paid nearly double the rewards that was originally agreed on.
</p>

:: QuestBountyHuntSlimeSuccess [nobr]

<p>
Your slavers turned out to be more than an even match for such a slime monstrosity,
and managed to dispatch it cleanly without any problem.
Your slavers then put samples from the slime's remains into the vial.
The vial smelled weird, and <<yourrep $g.negotiator>> could not help but somehow
became aroused by it.
It made <<them $g.negotiator>> wonder just what kind of potion the
alchemist needed such an ingredient for.
</p>

:: QuestBountyHuntSlimeFailure [nobr]

<p>
Unfortunately, despite having the upper hand, your slavers sloppily allowed
the slime to escape in the middle of the fight by sliding into the gutter.
Your slavers did not manage to find any other slime during their venture
and had to return back to the fort empty-handed.
</p>


:: QuestBountyHuntSlimeDisaster [nobr]

<p>
Your slavers lost to the slime, and ended up submitting to the creature's whims.
<<if $g.negotiator.isHasDick() and $g.merc1.isHasDick() and $g.merc2.isHasDick()>>
The trio's balls were completely drained
<<elseif $g.negotiator.isHasVagina() and $g.merc1.isHasVagina() and $g.merc2.isHasVagina()>>
The trio's breasts were completely drained
<<else>>
They were drained
both from their balls and from their breasts,
<</if>>
over and over again for a few hours.
It would require several weeks for them to recover mentally from such trauma.
You have the sneaking suspicion that the slavers deliberately submitted to the slime
out of pure curiosity, but there was just no way to confirm this suspicion.
</p>
