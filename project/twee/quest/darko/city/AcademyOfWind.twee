:: QuestAcademyOfWind [nobr]

<p>
The Academy of Wind is one the most well known magic institutes spread throughout <<lore geo_mestia>>.
The academy accepts students of any background, so long they display aptitude for <<lore magic_wind>>.
The vast majority of them are the citizens of the wind-attuned <<rep $company.humankingdom>>, however.
Graduates of the academy are highly sought after, and many important positions in the kingdom
are filled by them.
</p>

<p>
You have just learned that one of the academy's students has just been expelled.
According to the rumors, <<their $g.dropout>> natural aptitude for <<lore magic_wind>> was
the subject of much jealousy from <<their $g.dropout>> peers, which ultimately resulted in other
students bribing the academy's higher ups to drop the student out.
Having an ex-member of the academy of wind as your slaver is perhaps too tempting of an idea,
and therefore it might just be worth it to try and seek this dropout out.
You can offer <<them $g.dropout>> revenge in exchange for joining your company.
</p>


:: QuestAcademyOfWindCrit [nobr]

<p>
With some difficulty, <<rep $g.recruiter>> managed to <<uadv $g.recruiter>>
find the dropout apparently already
planning <<their $g.dropout>> own somewhat shoddy revenge plan against
<<their $g.dropout>> former classmates.
As an experienced slavers, your slavers were able to improve the plan.

<<set _cre = setup.selectUnit([$g.recruiter, $g.prankster1, $g.prankster2], {trait: 'skill_creative'})>>
<<if _cre>>
In particular, <<reps _cre>> mind was particularly inventive.
<</if>>

<<set _evil = setup.selectUnit([$g.recruiter, $g.prankster1, $g.prankster2], {trait: 'per_evil'})>>
<<if _evil>>
<<Reps _evil>> true degenerate personality helped ascend the plan into something even more degenerate.
<</if>>

With the plan complete, the dropout, who introduced <<themself $g.dropout>> as <<rep $g.dropout>>, agreed
to join your company should your slavers helped <<them $g.dropout>> enact the plan.
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>

<p>
The next day, your slavers went into the academy and
sneaked into <<reps $g.victim>> room, who will be the victim of the park,
and dropped the surprise package in front of <<their $g.victim>> door.
The surprise package was in fact one of the spellbooks that the dropout had written.
Upon returning to <<their $g.victim>> room, <<rep $g.victim>> found the book and,
hungry for power as <<they $g.victim>> victim|was, excitedly went to <<their
$g.victim>> room to study the book.
But the book had been tampered with -- as <<rep $g.victim>> became engrossed
with the book, <<they $g.victim>> failed to realize that the book had been modified into a
long incantation of the spell of self-binding. Within moments from finishing
the book, otherwordly tendrils were summoned out of nowhere,
coiling around <<their $g.victim>> unsuspecting body,
securing <<their $g.victim>> limbs behind their body in a hog-tied position.
The coils also wrapped tightly and painfully around
<<their $g.victim>> <<ubreasts $g.victim>> and <<ubelly $g.victim>>,
forcing <<them $g.victim>> to lay helplessly on the floor.
Another set of coil wrapped harshly around
<<if $g.victim.isHasDick()>>
the base of <<their $g.victim>>
dick, forcing the shaft to be erect but preventing <<them $g.victim>> from actually climaxing.
<<else>>
and into <<their $g.victim>> vagina, giving continuous pain while preventing
<<them $g.victim>> from actually receiving pleasure.
<</if>>
As a final touch, <<their $g.victim>> <<umouth $g.victim>> was fitted with a knot-gag,
rendering everything <<they $g.victim>> say into guttural moans.
</p>

<p>
Later that night, your slavers returned to <<reps $g.victim>> room together with
the dropout <<rep $g.dropout>>. <<Rep $g.victim>> victim|was at first almost
relieved to see someone entering
<<their $g.victim>> room, only to recognize the dropout <<rep $g.dropout>> in horror.
Having <<their $g.dropout>> revenge in spades,
<<rep $g.dropout>> happily went to your fort together with your slavers
and in tow and a new magical slave to break. All in all, it was a good day of work.
</p>

<<else>>

<p>
The plan was simple -- to humiliate the student <<rep $g.victim>> in front of as many people as they could.
The centerpoint of the Academy of Wind is the statue of their founder, posed
with one arm pointing to the sky triumphantly.
In the fateful day, as <<rep $g.victim>> victim|was just passing through the courtyard,
the dropout <<rep $g.dropout>> and your slavers unleashed the prepared wind spell.
Within seconds, a large gust of wind were summoned in the academy, and <<rep $g.victim>>
victim|was caught in the middle of it.
<<Rep $g.victim>> could do nothing but watch and struggle in horror as <<they $g.victim>>
victim|was lifted up into the air and gently placed right above the statue upwards-pointing arm.
As <<rep $g.dropout>> explained to <<them $g.victim>> what was about to happen, the wind spell
fizzled, impaling <<reps $g.victim>> ass straight into the statue's sizable arm.
<<Rep $g.dropout>> and your slavers quickly make their exit to watch from afar as the
student screamed in agony of the statuesque assrape.
</p>

<p>
With <<their $g.dropout>> revenge served in spades, <<rep $g.dropout>>
happily joined your slaving company.
<<They $g.dropout>> with <<their $g.dropout>> mastery over <<rep setup.trait.magic_wind>>
will surely make a fine slaver.
</p>

<</if>>

<p>
Unfortunately, your slaver was not able to locate the dropout within the vast
<<lore region_city>>.
Checking the local tavern, inn, or even asking around the academy did not yield any result.
</p>


:: QuestAcademyOfWindDisaster [nobr]

<p>
With some difficulty, <<rep $g.recruiter>> managed to <<uadv $g.recruiter>>
find the dropout apparently already
planning <<their $g.dropout>> own somewhat shoddy revenge plan against
<<their $g.dropout>> former classmates.
The plan was already complete by the time your slavers arrived, but <<rep $g.dropout>> agreed
to join your company should your slavers helped <<them $g.dropout>> enact the plan.
</p>

<p>
The next day, your slavers sneaked into the prospective victim <<reps $g.victim>> room in the academy, and
dropped the surprise package in front of <<their $g.victim>> door.
The surprise package was in fact, one of the spellbooks that the dropout had written.
<<Reps $g.prankster1>> curiosity, however,
got the better of <<them $g.prankster1>> and
<<they $g.prankster1>> felt there would be no harm to read a part of the book.
But it turned out to be a big mistake.
Within moments, otherwordly tentacles appeared out of nowhere and
coiled around both <<yourrep $g.prankster1>> and <<rep $g.prankster2>> unsuspecting bodies,
securing their limbs behind their bodies
in hog-tied positions and immobilizing them completely.
Apparently, <<rep $g.dropout>> also made the spell pay very special attention to the victim's "special parts",
which were bound by even tighter coil to make them constantly stimulated but unable to reach climax.
As a final touch, their mouths were also rendered useless by being fitted with large knot-gags.
</p>

<p>
Your slavers had to endure hours of being tied in such uncomfortable positions before eventually being found
by the academy staffs in the morning.
While uninjured, this experience has deeply changed your slavers, awakening some kind of
submissive behaviors in them, as well as earning the academy's wrath for trespassing upon
their domain.
</p>
