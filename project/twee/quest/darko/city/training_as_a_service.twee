<p>
Since the abolishment of slavery in the <<rep $company.humankingdom>> over ten years ago,
the demand for slave training services has understandably declined. This
leads to many slave training schools to close shop, making it
difficult for undercity patrons who wish to have their slaves trained.
</p>

<p>
As a slaving company, this becomes an opportunity for you. You can try to
send a group of slavers to find prospective buyers for slave training
services. Most likely, they will supply your company with a disobedient slave
that you must break. The more trainings you manage to dish out in time,
the better the pay, but
there is likely a strict time limit on how long you can train the slaves for.
If your company is up for the job, this could be a profitable endeavor.

<<Yourrep $g.informer>> managed to find your company a client in the undercity of Lucgate,
<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
a grizzled <<lady $g.client>> who were just gifted two fresh slaves by
<<their $g.client>> friend, completely untrained.
<<else>>
a young <<lady $g.client>> who had just acquired <<their $g.client>> first ever slave and was
completely clueless about how to possibly train the disobedient slave.
<</if>>
</p>

<p>
To prove your company's worth,
<<rep $g.trainer>> <<uadv $g.trainer>> demonstrated
<<if $g.trainer.isHasTrait('per_kind')>>
basic

masterful
<</if>>
slaving
technique on the slaves, which impressed the <<lady $g.client>>. <<Rep
$g.salesman>> negotiated a good deal for the training â€” you are to dish
whatever training you want on the

two slaves,
who must both

who must
<</if>>
be returned strictly within eight weeks. The client has a preference for certain training,
which will give greater rewards should they be fulfilled, but these are optional.

<<Rep $g.informer>> informer|was unable to find potential clients for your
slavers. After one week of fruitless search, your slavers returned to your
fort empty-handed.

<p>
The undercity of Lucgate proved to be a highly dangerous place.
