:: QuestGiftExchange [nobr]

<p>
On the night of certain months, there is a tradition in the <<lore region_city>>
where people blindly exchange gifts with strangers.
While traditionally people exchange standard gifts such as food or
cooking utensils, some particularly adventurous circle of people in the city
use the opportunity to exchange slaves packed prettily in a box.
You have been invited into such an exchange. If you are willing to part
with one of your slaves, the reward could be very worth the price.
</p>

<p>
<<dangertext 'WARNING'>>: The slave you sent on this quest will be gone forever,
shipped as a gift to some unknown conoisseur...
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
  <<if $g.gift.isMale()>>
    <<questimage 'gift_exchange_male.jpg'>>
  <<else>>
    <<questimage 'gift_exchange_female.jpg'>>
  <</if>>
<</if>>

<p>
<<Yourrep $g.present>> present|was fully bound and blindfolded from head to toe,
before being placed into a holey box and tied nicely with a ribbon.
<<Rep $g.present>> present|was then shipped by your slavers, to be the new plaything
of some lucky owner.
<<set _lavish = setup.selectUnit([$g.santa, $g.elf1, $g.elf2], {trait: 'per_lavish'})>>
<<set _frugal = setup.selectUnit([$g.santa, $g.elf1, $g.elf2], {trait: 'per_frugal'})>>

<<if _lavish>>
Giving away gifts is completely within <<reps _lavish>> generous nature, adding to the
immersion.
<<elseif _frugal>>
<<Rep _frugal>> almost scoffed at the idea of giving such a slave away,
the greedy slaver clearly not seeing the benefit of the endeavor.
<</if>>

<<set _playful = setup.selectUnit([$g.santa, $g.elf1, $g.elf2], {trait: 'per_playful'})>>
<<set _serious = setup.selectUnit([$g.santa, $g.elf1, $g.elf2], {trait: 'per_serious'})>>

<<if _playful>>
<<Rep _playful>> playfully added several finishing touch to the decoration, including an
oversized candy cane shoved deep within the slave's rear.
<<elseif _serious>>
<<Rep _serious>> took the entire job extremely seriously, and did not even bother to
decorate the "gift".
<</if>>
</p>

<p>
A few weeks after the shipment, you receive a huge package yourself
delivered straight to your fort.
You checked and examine the box.
There was no sender on the box, the only note being "Use Well!".
Sensing danger, you order your other slavers to stand by and watch over
as you open the box.
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>

<p>
As you start to unwrap the box, a sudden move from the box caught you by surprise.
Could there be some kind of trap inside? As you opened it further, you started to hear
moaning and breathing sounds coming from inside. This made you and your slavers
more eager to unwrap it faster. When all the wrapping were undone, your present
lied in full bondage before you -- a <<urace $g.gift>> blindfolded
and fully bound with all of <<their $g.gift>> holes fitted
with various festive-looking sex toys.
Happy holidays!
</p>

<<elseif $gOutcome == 'success'>>

<p>
You unwrapped the box slowly but carefully, not wishing whatever danger inside to
catch you by surprise.
But there was no such surprise -- fully unpacked, a grand golden statue of
yourself stood before you in its full glory.
You could not fathom how such statue of your liking could come to exist,
given that you have never really showed your face to any of the game's participants.
While you contemplated keeping the statue as decoration in your office, you felt the money
you can get by smelting the statue and selling the gold might be of more interest
for your business.
</p>

<<elseif $gOutcome == 'failure'>>

<p>
You unwrapped the box slowly but carefully, not wishing whatever danger inside to
catch you by surprise.
But inside the box was another box, and inside it was another box.
This continued on until the very tiny boxd in the middle that contain a small lump of gold,
clearly not enough to compensate for <<reps $g.present>> value.
You ponder who could have dared to send such a measly gift in this dangerous game,
as there are rumors that people whose gift were subpar tend to receive misfortune
in the days to come.
</p>

<<else>>

<p>
You unwrapped the box slowly, but you accidentaly shook the box, which
then proceeded to violently explodes.
Miraculously, you and your slavers were unharmed, but a significant
damage had been done to your fort, which cost money to repair.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps sending such a subpar slave as <<rep $g.present>> was not a good idea after all.
</p>
