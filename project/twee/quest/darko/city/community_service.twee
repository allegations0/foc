The humans living in the <<rep $company.humankingdom>> are the most
populous of all the races in <<lore continent_main>>. People
from all sort of occupations live in the <<lore region_city>>, from the noblest of
nobles to the lowliest of beggars.
</p>

<p>
Occasionally, your company receive slave orders for a regular <<lore race_humankingdom>>.
If you need such a slave, one of
the easiest way is by venturing into the <<lore region_city>>, and "hire" one
of the numerous beggars living off its streets.
Nobody will miss them, and maybe they could finally be the productive member of the
society they always wanted to be by becoming your slave.

<p>
Unfortunately, <<yourrep $g.seducer>> seducer|was not charismatic enough to
attract even the beggars of the city to come with <<them $g.seducer>>.
After wasting a week in the city without gain, they decided to go home.

<<Rep $g.seducer>> managed to catch the attention of the guards who
recognized <<them $g.seducer>> as part of a slaving company. Your slavers had
to fight to get out of the city and returned home injured.
