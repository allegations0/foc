<<set _u = setup.getUnit({tag: 'in_training_defiant_slave'})>>

<<if !_u>>
  <<missingunitquest>>
<<else>>
<p>
<<Yourrep _u>> has continued to be a stubborn little slut. If all other
methods have failed to break <<therace _u>>, there is always the option of
simply breaking <<their _u>> mind. But normal methods won't work on <<them
_u>>, and even more extreme measures have to be taken to do so.
</p>

<p>
Your slavers have managed to secure a deal with one of the more prominent
leaders of the undercity of Lucgate. These sadistic leaders enjoy slowly breaking
particularly defiant slave, and have offered to lend you a small spot in the
location, where the slave can be locked inside the stocks there.
The slave will then be made available for public use —
the sadistic public members of the undercity that is. These are
people who revel in the suffering of others, and will no doubt turn
every single passing day into living hell for the slave. Ordinary slaves
would only take one or two weeks to be completely broken this way, but this
particularly defiant slave might take longer — a few months, you would guess.
</p>

<p>
You can send the slave together with an overseer if you wish to break <<yourrep
_u>> this way. The overseer would have to unlock the slave each night, and
clean the no-doubt well-used slave before locking the slave back for the next
day. While the slave will surely be broken this way, <<their _u>> mind will
also guaranteed to be completely shattered and broken, becoming useful for
nothing else other than a living sex toy. But sometimes extreme measures need
to be taken for extreme cases...
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, you can always ignore this quest, and try to break the slave via other means.

<p>
With
<<if $g.handler.isHasTrait('per_kind')>>
a little reluctance,
<<else>>
a cruel grin,
<</if>>
<<rep $g.handler>> introduced to <<rep $g.slave>> what would be <<their
$g.slave>> home for the next few months — a non-descript stock placed
securely in the center of the undercity. At first, <<rep $g.slave>> remained
defiant, thinking that being locked in the stocks could not be that bad. But
once <<they $g.slave>> got familiar with the residents, <<they $g.slave>>
could have not been so wrong...
</p>

<p>
The undercity hosts the worst of the LucGate residents, including a
particularly large number of sadists. None of them could resist the allure of having
a helpless and defiant slave being locked in the center of the undercity. In fact, the slave's
struggles as <<they $g.slave>> slave|was being continuously raped each day only made
the assaulters more aroused, and soon all residents from all corners of the
undercity came to the square to try out the slave's orifices.
<<if !$settings.bannedtags.watersport>>
  Not a single hole of <<rep $g.slave>> slave|was left unused -- and <<they
  $g.slave>> experienced
  many occassion of simultaneously being raped from the ass while gulping
  down piss down <<their $g.slave>> throat.
<</if>>
<<if $g.handler.isHasTrait('per_cruel')>>
Being a sadist <<themself $g.handler>>, <<rep $g.handler>> helped out the
breaking process too, and <<they $g.handler>> together with your slave often
enjoy some "private time" after the day was over.
<<else>>
<<Yourrep $g.handler>> handler|was not a sadist however, and <<they
$g.handler>> even sometimes felt kinda bad for the slave.
Still, <<they $g.handler>> <<uadv $g.handler>>
unlocked the binding each night to clean the filth out of the always
well-abused slave, before locking the slave back for the night.
<</if>>
</p>

<p>
Within weeks, <<yourrep $g.handler>> could easily notice a drastic change in the
slave — <<their $g.slave>> mind getting worn down so quickly until it finally
snapped.
By the end of the ordeal, the slave was pretty much broken in mind and spirit. While
<<their $g.slave>> body remained the same — there was absolutely no trace of
<<their $g.slave>> former fighting spirit. With the very long mission finally
over, <<rep $g.handler>> brought the new fuck toy back to the fort, to be
enjoyed by the rest of <<their $g.handler>> slaver mates.
