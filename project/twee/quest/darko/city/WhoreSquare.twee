:: QuestWhoreSquare [nobr]

<p>
While slavery has been outlawed in the <<rep $company.humankingdom>>,
it is still very much alive in its undercity.
A particular famous place within the undercity is the establishment known as The Whoring Square.
While standard undercity brothels offer slaves who are permanently assigned there,
the Whoring Square instead setups booths where clients can offer to purchase a booth
to attempt to sell their slaves' services there.
Some clients like to use this to punish their slaves -- nothing breaks a slave faster
than being forced to service unknown and unsatiable list of customers.
Some others enjoy the tips that the patrons usually give generously to the slaves,
which almost always covers the booth's renting fee.
You have heard that the Whoring Square is looking for tenants right now. You
can send a team of slavers together with a highly valuable slave for profit,
if you choose. The more valuable the slave, the higher the potential profit, but of
course there is a limit for such a thing.
</p>

<p>
Your slaver's booth was located in the corner of the place.
The booth itself was simple, just four set of manacles to chain
each of your slave's limbs to the ground.
There were multiple possible chains to choose from, which can be adjusted 
based on the preferred position of the slave.
</p>

<p>
Having setup the slave and just waiting for customers,
your slavers couldn't help but look around the fine establishment.
Various other tenants were also offering slaves --
some of the slaves were positioned in a sitting position for giving blowjobs,
others were chained in a doggy position to be used as a fuckhole.

<<set _lust = setup.selectUnit([$g.slavetrader, $g.guard1, $g.guard2], {trait: 'per_lustful'})>>

<<if $g.slavetrader.isYou() or $g.guard1.isYou() or $g.guard2.isYou()>>
Since you personally have come to the establishment,
the neighboring tenant happen to recognize you, before
offering their slave for a trial use, if you choose to.
<<message "(Partake)">>
The tenant introduced the slave, the aptly named "Cumslut" whose real named had long been stamped away.
Apparently, cumslut there was a warrior of the northern region who had accumulated quite a bit of bounty before
being captured. But according to the tenant, these warriors are very easy to break -- in fact,
he claimed to have broken this slave within only eight hours of torture. The slave was brought here as punishment
for reacting to their original name -- the punishment being that the slave must service customers since cum
will be <<their $g.slave>> only nourishment during their stay here.
The slave was positioned in a kneeling position, with mouth ring-gagged to constantly let dick in.
<<if $unit.player.isHasDick()>>
You eagerly began to feed the willing slave, willing given that <<they $g.slave>> had no choice but to suck dick
if <<they $g.slave>> did not want to starve.
You inserted your <<udick $unit.player>> into the slave's mouth, before spraying cum straight down
<<their $g.slave>> throat.
<</if>>
As you use the slave, you wonder if such punishment is effective enough to use on your own slaves...
<</message>>
<<elseif _lust>>
<<Rep _lust>>, being the rather lustful <<urace _lust>>, helped <<themself _lust>> test some
of <<their _lust>> tenants' merchandise before the establishment opened.
<</if>>
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
<p>
At the end of the week, <<yourrep $g.slave>> slave|was covered in semen and completely exhausted from
being used by much more customers than your slavers had expected.
The experience would have broken any normal slave, if they had not been broken already.
The customers left quite a large amount of tips too.
</p>

<<elseif $gOutcome == 'success'>>
<p>
By the end of the week, <<rep $g.slave>> slave|was covered in quite a bit of semen,
<<if $g.slave.isHasTrait(setup.trait.dick_tiny)>>both from the client's orgasms
and <<their $g.slave>> own when <<they $g.slave>> was milked during the downtime
<<else>>
from the clients' orgasms.
<</if>>
The experience would have broken any normal slave, if they had not broken already.
Your slavers managed to gather quite a few tips from the customers perusing the slave.
</p>

<<else>>

<p>
Unfortunately, your neighbor's eloquent story about their slave swayed
most of the customers in your slavers' area to their slave instead.
<<Yourrep $g.slave>> slave|was only able to attract a few customers,
including one particularly well-dressed client who had a specific fetish for
<<urace $g.slave>> slaves.
</p>

<</if>>

:: QuestWhoreSquareDisaster [nobr]

<p>
Unfortunately, a particularly rowdy customer accidentally used your slave
way too hard and left <<them $g.slave>> injured.
Your slavers had no choice but to unshackle <<theslaver $g.slave>> and brought
<<them $g.slave>> home to recover, before retrying again.
</p>
