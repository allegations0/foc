:: Quest_pet_shop_of_wonders [nobr]

<<include 'Opportunity_pet_shopping'>>

<p>
You have decided to order a
<<if $g.pet.isMale()>>
male
<<else>>
female
<</if>>
pet.
</p>


:: Quest_pet_shop_of_wondersCrit [nobr]

<p>
The pet shop was disguised as an ordinary pet shop â€” the front counter
showcased dogs, cats, and other ordinary and cute pets for sale. Having an
appointment, your slavers were escorted to the main atrium of their
warehouse...
</p>

<p>
While the warehouse looked unimpressive from the outside, the interior was
nothing but high class. The floors were scrubbed sparking clean and the interior was
fully decorated. Your slavers were escorted to one of the rooms containing a
single draped cage.
</p>

<p>
Inside the cage, you found a slave who immediately stood to attention and
presented <<their $g.pet>> best begging posture to your slavers, proof that
<<they $g.pet>> was already fully trained.
<<if $g.appraiser.isHasTrait('per_dreamy')>>
<<Yourrep $g.appraiser>> lazily did a quick pass
<<else>>
<<Yourrep $g.appraiser>> did a complete check
<</if>>
on the slave's personalities,
body shape, and genitals
<<if $g.appraiser.isHasTrait('per_dreamy')>>
just giving a small sanity check that
<<else>>
making sure
<</if>>
<<they $g.pet>> was exactly what you ordered.
Satisfied, your slavers concluded the deal before going home with a new and eager
pet in tow.
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
<p>
The shop even threw in a complimentary bonus to your slavers: a golden pet gear
suitable for such highly trained slave.
</p>
<<elseif $gOutcome == 'failure'>>
<p>
Unknown to the other slavers, <<rep $g.buyer1>> out of curiosity ventured
into the other parts of the warehouse.
It was the last time your slavers ever saw <<them $g.buyer1>> during the
quest.
<<urescuenow $g.buyer1>>.
</p>
<<elseif $gOutcome == 'disaster'>>
<p>
It was unclear how it happened but <<yourrep $g.buyer1>> never came back from the
trip into the warehouse. Perhaps you will see <<them $g.buyer1>> again, or
perhaps <<they $g.buyer1>> will live a happy live as a loyal pet to some
other owner...
</p>
