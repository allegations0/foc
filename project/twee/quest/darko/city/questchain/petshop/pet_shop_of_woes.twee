<<include 'Opportunity_pet_shopping'>>

<p>
You have decided to send a team of slavers as "interns".
</p>

:: Quest_pet_shop_of_woesCrit [nobr]

<p>
The pet shop was disguised as an ordinary pet shop — the front counter
showcased dogs, cats, and other ordinary and cute pets for sale. Coming
to work, your slavers were escored to an employee-only area.
</p>

<p>
<<Rep $g.salesman>> salesman|was immediately put to work for helping
customers choose their perfect pet. Meanwhile, <<rep $g.trainer1>> and <<rep
$g.trainer2>> were tasked with training a newly captured slave, a former
raider, into the perfect pet. Fortunately, the shop has
a standard training procedure to help your slavers with the training process.
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'failure'>>

<p>
Either because the slave was truly unruly, or because of your slavers were
incompentence, by the end of the internship,
the slave remained defiant but badly injured.
Seeing the failure, your slavers were kicked out of the compound while
the shop salvaged the broken wreck of the slave by turning the slave into a
prospective pony slave instead.
</p>

<p>
For such awful work your slavers were not paid a single penny despite their hard work,
while <<rep $g.salesman>> salesman|was taken as due recompense.
<<urescuenow $g.salesman>>, before <<they $g.salesman>> salesman|is fully trained as just another nameless pet...
</p>

<<elseif $gOutcome == 'disaster'>>

<p>
It was unclear how, but during the training the prospective pet snapped and
its mind broke. Your slavers were held accountable and <<rep $g.salesman>>
salesman|was taken by the shop as a payment for the damages, to be trained as
a replacement for the pet your slavers had broke.
</p>

<<else>>

<p>
With the help of various training equipment including blindfolds, gags,
chastity belt, as well as plenty and plenty of leashes and puppy gears,
your slavers slowly transformed
the initially unwilling slave until finally, at the end of the month, the
slave would willingly come and lick your slaver's feet clean while having
their butt stuffed full with a large tailplug.

<<set _slaver = setup.selectUnit([$g.trainer1, $g.trainer2], {trait: 'bg_slaver'})>>
<<if _slaver>>
  <<Reps _slaver>> past as a slaver made the training slightly easier, and <<they _slaver>>
  employed some rather unorthodox technique in training the slave.
<</if>>

<<set _wind = setup.selectUnit([$g.trainer1, $g.trainer2], {trait: 'magic_wind'})>>
<<if _wind>>
  <<Reps _wind>> mastery over wind magic was instrumental during the trainings.
<</if>>

</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
<p>
Your slavers went above and beyond and the pet would now qualify as
a masterful pet slut. For such impressive work, your slavers were given
double the promised reward — two golden pet gears suitable for high class
pets.
The pet your slavers had fully trained will live a fulfilling live in
the kennel provided by its prospective <<master $unit.player>>.
</p>
<<else>>

<p>
When their internship ended, your slavers were given the promised reward — a
golden pet gear suitable for high class pets, for the good work they had
done. The pet they trained will live a fulfilling live in the feet of its new
<<master $unit.player>>.
