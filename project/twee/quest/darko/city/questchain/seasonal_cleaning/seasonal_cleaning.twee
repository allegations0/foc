:: Quest_seasonal_cleaning [nobr]

<p>
The nobles of the <<rep $company.humankingdom>> often live in grand mansions staffed full with
maids of various origins. occasionally, these mansion hires part-time maids
to help clean up after particularly debauched parties being held in the mansion. These jobs
often pay well, and well deservedly considering the various kinds of questionable mess they
will have to clean.
</p>

<p>
These kinds of job usually do not interest your company at all, but one such
offer came from a particularly well-known noble: the <<lord $g.rich>> <<name $g.rich>>.
<<They $g.rich>> rich|is the sole inheritor of an estate, and to the best of your
knowledge <<they $g.rich>> rich|have no other relative nor <<they $g.rich>>
rich|have married. In fact, if the rumors were to be believed, the main reason
<<they $g.rich>> looked for a maid is to search for a life-long companion to
serve <<them $g.rich>> both formally and informally.
</p>

<p>
If you have a particularly convincing slaver, you could try to send them on
this job. Given the prudeness of the noble, the most likely scenario is that
nothing happens and your slavers just get paid for their job. But with a
particularly convincing and sexy slaver, who knows what might happen...
</p>


:: Quest_seasonal_cleaningCrit [nobr]

<p>
Throughout their stay in the mansion, <<rep $g.head>> somehow managed to
secure the attention of the mansion's <<lord $g.rich>>.
It probably is thanks to <<their $g.head>> <<upraisenoun $g.head>>.
Oftentimes, <<rep
$g.rich>> would request for <<rep $g.head>> to privately clean <<their
$g.rich>> bedchamber, and the two would disappear for hours to come. When
asked about it, <<yourrep $g.head>> <<uadv $g.head>> refused to answer, but
promised that the company would benefit greatly from whatever was happening
there. Only time will tell if this promise will actually be fulfilled in
the future...
</p>

<p>
Still, there was much work to be done cleaning all the questionable stains
left on the sofas and the floor. With the help of your experienced slavers
the work was done efficiently, restoring the mansion back to a pristine state.
For such splendid work your slavers were paid greatly by the <<lord
$g.rich>>.
</p>


:: Quest_seasonal_cleaningSuccess [nobr]

<p>
The amount of work in the mansion were so much more than your slavers had
anticipated, and <<yourrep $g.head>> had no time to attempt to seduce or even
befriend the <<lord $g.rich>> of the mansion. Numerous questionable stains of
various smells littered the entire mansion, be it on the sofas in the living
room, the piano, or even from inside the extinguished fireplace.
</p>

<p>
Using their knowledge and wit your slavers managed to
<<uadv $g.head>> clean up all the mess, while trying their best not to
imagine how these stains came to be in the first place.
</p>

<p>
Your slaver were paid well for the job, although a little disappointed for
not being able to execute the degenerate plan of yours. Perhaps there will be
another chance.
</p>


:: Quest_seasonal_cleaningFailure [nobr]

<p>
The amount of work in the mansion were so much more than your slavers had
anticipated, and <<yourrep $g.head>> had no time to
seduce or befriend the <<lord $g.rich>> of the mansion.
Numerous questionable stains emitting various
stench littered the entire mansion, be it on the sofas in the living room, the
piano, or even from inside the extinguished fireplace.
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'failure'>>
<p>
Your slavers managed to finish the job, but they were clearly shaken by the experience.
</p>
<<else>>
<p>
Your slavers did not have to imagine hard what happened as one of the guests
appeared to not have left the mansion yet. Given no choice, your slavers were forced to service
the guest. In the end, although your slavers were paid well for the job, they
were clearly shaken by the entire ordeal.
