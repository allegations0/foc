<<set _headunit = $company.player.getUnits({title: "seasonal_cleaning_head"})>>
<<if !_headunit.length>>
<<dangertext "Due to your company missing a slaver important for this quest, this job is no longer able to be completed.">>

<<set _headunit = _headunit[0]>>
<p>
Some time ago, your company took a domestic job from a well known noble in
the city, <<rep $g.rich>>. According to the letter you have just received, the noble was
apparently very happy with the overall job last time, and asks for another round of
seasonal cleaning. <<They $g.rich>> promises to pay even more this time, but
under the condition that the exemplary <<maid _headunit>> <<rep _headunit>>
would join the team.
</p>

<p>
It seems particularly odd and dangerous that such a noble would request one
of your slavers by name, but when asked about it,
<<yourrep _headunit>> actually seems eager to go and "finish what <<they
_headunit>> have started". Still, the noble promises great amount of reward
and it would be remiss to miss out on such an easy opportunity.
</p>
<</if>>

<<if $g.rich.isMale()>>
<<else>>
  <<questimage 'seasonal__cleaning_female.jpg'>>
<</if>>

<p>
Just like before, the noble asked <<rep $g.head>> for <<their $g.head>>
personal attention in the bedchamber.
Your other slavers never noticed the lusty and needy face that the noble
made whenever <<they $g.rich>> was near <<rep $g.head>> â€”
or was it never there before? 
This time, <<rep $g.head>> instead
<<if $g.head.isHasTrait('per_submissive')>>
did <<their $g.head>> best (despite <<their $g.head>> submissive nature) to take
control and demand
<<else>>
took control and demanded
<</if>>
various
increasingly degenerate things from the noble in order, promising that
if the noble continued to be a good <<boy $g.rich>>, <<they $g.rich>> will be
"rewarded" with a private session in the bedchamber.
By the end of the seasonal job,
<<yourrep $g.head>> had fully trained the noble in various degenerate acts, be it
to present <<themself $g.rich>> at command, or even to lick <<reps $g.head>>
<<ucfeet $g.head>>, all for a chance to get rewarded by being allowed to <<if $g.head.isHasDick()>>blow
<<their $g.rich>> <<master $g.head>>'s dick<<else>>lick <<their $g.rich>>
<<master $g.head>>'s pussy<</if>>
</p>

<p>
<<Rep $g.head>> <<uadv $g.head>> extorted a huge sum of money from the noble,
before leaving the noble to clean up after the new mess. You get
the feeling that you'll hear back from the noble again.
</p>


:: Quest_seasonal__cleaning_Success [nobr]

<p>
While <<rep $g.maid1>> and <<rep $g.maid2>> <<uadv $g.maid1>> cleaned the
mansion,
just like before, <<yourrep $g.rich>> often went missing during their stay in the
mansion. Only it was more obvious this time where <<they $g.rich>> had went,
what's with the occasional humping and moaning noises coming up from the bedchamber.
There was still a great deal of mess to clean, however, so your other slavers decided not to dwell
too much on it and just try to finish the somewhat mundane job and get the promised reward.
</p>


:: Quest_seasonal__cleaning_Failure [nobr]

<p>
The amount of work in the mansion were so much more than your slavers had
anticipated, and <<yourrep $g.head>> had no time to advance their "intimacy" with
the <<lord $g.rich>> of the mansion. Numerous questionable stains emitting various
stench littered the entire mansion, be it on the sofas in the living room, the
piano, or even from inside the extinguished fireplace.
</p>

<p>
Your slavers managed to finish the job, but they were clearly shaken by the experience.
</p>


:: Quest_seasonal__cleaning_Disaster [nobr]

<p>
Unfortunately, <<yourrep $g.head>> tried to take it too far with the noble.
When <<therace $g.head>> attempted to make the noble lick <<their $g.head>>
<<ucfeet $g.head>>, something in the noble snapped and immediately ordered all your slavers
to get out of the vicinity. Although no immediate harm befall your slavers, it is unlikely
that the noble would request specifically for <<rep $g.head>> again in the future, and
whatever it was that <<theslaver $g.head>> had schemed must restart from the beginning.
</p>
