<<set _headunit = $company.player.getUnits({title: "seasonal_cleaning_head_full"})>>
<<if !_headunit.length>>
<<dangertext "Due to your company missing a slaver important for this quest, this job is no longer able to be completed.">>

<<set _headunit = _headunit[0]>>

<p>
Your company receives yet another letter from the city noble <<rep $g.rich>>
who as far as you understand, has been effectively enslaved by <<yourrep _headunit>>.
This time, there was no longer any pretense of cleaning service — the slave
simply begs in the letter for <<their $g.rich>> master to <<uadv _headunit>> punish
them.
</p>

<p>
<<rep _headunit>> will surely be eager to play with <<their _headunit>>
misbehaving slave, and can certainly extort the slave for even more money and
perhaps a little souvenir while <<they _headunit>>'s at it. All in all, <<rep
_headunit>> did a wonderful job in converting the formerly chaste and lonely
noble into what <<they $g.rich>> rich|is right now.
</p>
<</if>>

<<if $g.rich.isMale()>>
<<else>>
  <<questimage 'seasonal_training_female.jpg'>>
<</if>>

<p>
When your slavers arrived, the noble immediately prostrated
<<themself $g.rich>> in front of <<their $g.rich>> <<master $g.head>>.
<<if $g.head.isHasTrait('per_kind')>>
Despite being a kind <<urace $g.head>>, <<yourrep $g.head>>
understood that a job is a job and
<<else>>
Grinning <<uadv $g.head>>,
<<yourrep $g.head>>
<</if>>
brought the noble-turned-slave straight away
into their private dungeon in the mansion while the rest of your slavers
enjoyed the various amenities in the mansion. Soon enough sounds of whipping
and moaning filled the dungeons, with <<rep $g.rich>> being in ecstacy from
receiving so much attention from <<their $g.rich>> <<master $g.head>>.
</p>

<p>
By the end of the week, your slavers emphasizes the pecking order within the mansion
by making their employer serve as the mansion's own
<<maid $g.rich>>, wiping <<their $g.rich>> own and your slavers' mess with
both a rag and their tongue. Your slavers made sure to instill further
obedience to the slave before leaving the mansion with one of
<<their $g.rich>> clothes as souvenir.
</p>


:: Quest_seasonal_trainingSuccess [nobr]

<p>
Your slavers arrived with a bang as <<rep $g.head>> immediately commanded
<<rep $g.rich>> to approach.
Seeing the obedience training was starting to
waver,
<<if $g.head.isHasTrait('per_kind')>>
<<yourrep $g.head>> suppressed their kind nature, since a job is a job, and
<<else>>
<<yourrep $g.head>> spent no time wasted and immediately
<</if>>
brought the
noble-turned-slave into <<their $g.rich>> own dungeon complex to have <<their $g.rich>>
training reinforced.
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'success'>>
<p>
In the coming days, sounds of whipping, moaning, and begging filled the
dungeons, with <<rep $g.rich>> being in a combined sensation from the pleasure and
pain administered <<uadv $g.head>> by their <<master $g.head>>. Meanwhile
your other slavers enjoyed the various amenities of the mansion including the
bedroom of the slave itself.
</p>

<p>
By the end of the week, <<rep $g.head>> head|was confident that the slave's
obedience training will continue to hold until their next visit. Your slavers proceeded to extort
large amount of money which the slave obediently agreed to. <<Yourrep $g.head>><<if
!$g.head.isHasDick()>>, donning a strap-on<</if>> gave the slave one last
proper throat fuck before leaving the mansion.
</p>

<<else>>

<p>
But <<rep $g.head>> accidentally injured <<themself $g.head>> during one of the
training sessions, but fortunately still managed to complete the reinforcement
training in time.
Your other slavers had to carry <<yourrep $g.head>> back home together with the
money they extorted from the noble.
</p>

<</if>>


:: Quest_seasonal_trainingDisaster [nobr]

<p>
Unfortunately, <<rep $g.head>> tried to take it too far with the noble.
When <<rep $g.head>> attempted to make <<them $g.rich>>
<<if $g.rich.isHasDick()>>choke on their own dick<<else>>
lick their own pussy<</if>>, something in the noble snapped and immediately
ordered all your slavers to get out from the vicinity.
<<Yourrep $g.head>> head|was
shocked that the noble still have so much fight left within, and was already outside
the mansion by the time <<they $g.head>> recovered from the shock. Still,
it was simply impossible for the noble to completely rebound from your slaver's
masterful trainings so far, and this was most likely just a temporary relapse.
