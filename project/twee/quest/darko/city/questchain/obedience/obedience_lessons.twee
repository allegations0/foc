<<if _u>>
<p>
The next class for <<yourrep _u>>'s training in the <<lore
location_institute_of_higher_learning>> is about the begin. As usual, your
slaver is expected to bring along a slave trained in <<rep
setup.trait.training_obedience_advanced>>, and is ready to be stamped out
entirely of whatever remains of their free will.
</p>
<<set _sc = $varstore.get('obedience_lesson')>>
<p>
<<if _sc >= 6>>
<<Yourrep _u>> looks much more confident this time, and you have no doubt
that the <<uadjgood _u>> slaver will graduate very soon from the course...
<<elseif _sc >= 3>>
While <<rep _u>> has obtained some basic knowledge, you can sense that the
<<uadjgood _u>> slaver still have some way to go before <<they _u>> can
graduate...
<<else>>
<<Yourrep _u>> is still far from graduation. Failure at this stage is inevitable,
and you should prepare that the worst will happen to whichever slave you decide to bring
along the quest...

<p>
  <<dangertext 'Warning'>>: Slaves brought along on this quest may not come back intact and well...

<<if Math.random() < 0.33>>
<<rep $g.student>> continued <<their $g.student>> study under the watchful
guidance of the instructors.
Many example slaves were used and left either broken or blindly obedient to
the instructors.
<<elseif Math.random() < 0.5>>
Weeks passed by as <<rep $g.student>> advanced <<their $g.student>> studies in
the academy, watching <<uadv $g.student>> as <<their $g.student>> instructors
demonstrated the various applications of pain, pleasure, and despair on the
available slaves.
<<else>>
Theory and practice were combined together in a single coherent course as
<<rep $g.student>> continued to improve <<their $g.student>> understanding on
how to properly bend one's will to another.
<</if>>

<<if $g.student.isHasTrait('per_studious')>>
  <<Rep $g.student>> student|love to study, and dutifully attended to the lessons.
<<elseif $g.student.isHasTrait('per_active')>>
  <<Rep $g.student>> student|hate studying, but forced <<themself $g.student>> to attend the lessons.
<</if>>

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
You did not think it was possible, but <<rep $g.student>> became a model
student throughout the courses, absorbing much of the knowledge.
<<set _add = 4>>

<<elseif $gOutcome == 'success'>>
Throughout the entire course, <<yourrep $g.student>> surprisingly remained
attentive, absorbing much of the new knowledge.
<<set _add = 3>>

<<elseif $gOutcome == 'failure'>>
<<Their $g.student>> understanding of the slaving art clearly improved,
although not by too much...
<<set _add = 2>>

<<elseif $gOutcome == 'disaster'>>
While <<they $g.student>> certainly improved, it could have been so much more
if <<they $g.student>> would just pay more attention during the class, instead of sleeping
through them...
<<set _add = 1>>
<</if>>

<<if Math.random() < 0.33>>
And finally, a demonstration was due as your slaver must apply their newfound knowledge
onto <<rep $g.slave>>...
<<elseif Math.random() < 0.5>>
And finally, it was time for <<rep $g.slave>> to be trained by your slaver,
to demonstrate that <<they $g.student>> had grasped what <<they $g.student>> had
just learned...
<<else>>
But before the class ended, your slaver must demonstrate <<their $g.student>>
understanding by applying it directly to <<rep $g.slave>>...
<</if>>
</p>

<<run setup.qc.VarAdd('obedience_lesson', _add, -1).apply($gQuest)>>

<<set _sc = $varstore.get('obedience_lesson')>>

<<if _sc >= 9>>

<p>
At long last, <<yourrep $g.student>> seemed to had finally grasped the secret to
perfectly rooting out free will out of the slaves. A careful ministration
of pain, pleasure, and despair must be applied, but all must be held in
perfect balance. Too much pain and the slave's body would succumb — too much pleasure
and the slave spirit would succumb — too much despair and the slave's mind
would succumb.
</p>

<p>
<<Yourrep $g.slave>> slave|was reduced to blindly obedience, happily
lapping and licking <<therace $g.student>>'s feel.
The instructors had no doubt that your slaver had finally ready to graduate, and so <<they $g.student>> did.
</p>

<p>
The <<lore location_institute_of_higher_learning>> would clearly welcome
<<theslaver $g.student>> should <<they $g.student>> one day decided to retire from your company, but for now
<<therace $g.student>> seemd to enjoy working under your employ. The new techniques and
knowledge <<they $g.student>> had acquired will surely prove useful in their continued career.
</p>

<<else>>

<<if $gQuest.getSeed() % 3 == 0>>
<p>
Unfortunately, your slaver understanding was still incomplete, and <<they
$g.student>> accidentally applied too much despair into the slave. <<Reps
$g.slave>> mind broke, reducing the once somewhat obedient slave into a
mindless body, usable as nothing but a living sex toy. Your slaver will have
to attend more classes if <<they $g.student>> still want to master this craft...
</p>
<<elseif $gQuest.getSeed() % 3 == 1>>
<p>
However, <<reps $g.student>> understanding of the application of pain was
still incomplete. The slave's body ended up too broken and the training had
to be stopped before the slave became fully broken.
It seems more classes are still needed before your slaver can graduate...
</p>
<<elseif $gQuest.getSeed() % 3 == 2>>
<p>
Disappointingly, it seemed <<rep $g.student>> student|was still not ready for
graduation. <<They $g.student>> gave too much pleasure to the slave,
restoring the slave's will too much. One night, the slave just disappeared from
<<their $g.slave>> slave quarters, seemingly having escaped from the academy. This
was a clear indicator of failure and your slaver will still need to attend
more lectures before <<they $g.student>> student|is ready to graduate...
