:: Quest_obedience_101 [nobr]

<p>
The <<lore region_city>> hosts the <<lore
location_institute_of_higher_learning>>, very popular among many nobles.
The institute boasts that all its graduates will become a productive member
of the noble society, no matter how rowdy or undisciplined the tutee was once.
</p>

<p>
A very rare opportunity has arrived for you and your slavers: the institute
is hiring! Or more specifically, they are opening a class for people who are
interested to be certified instructors in the academy. Graduates from this
class will surely be capable of instilling obedience to even the most
stubborn of students! A most beneficial skill to have for a slaving company.
</p>

<p>
There is a matter of some registration fee and red tape to navigate through,
however. Best to accompany the prospective instructor with some slavers adept
at bureaucracy.
</p>

<p>
After many exchanges above and below, and sometimes even under the desk, <<yourrep
$g.clerk1>> and <<utheirrel $g.clerk1 $g.clerk2>> <<rep $g.clerk2>> managed
to finally contact the headmaster of the institution. With a knowing nod, the
headmaster accepted <<yourrep $g.student>> as a candidate instructor. Lessons
will begin shortly â€” after the full tuition fee was paid by your slavers of
course.
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
<p>
In fact, your slavers were so convincing that the school's opinion of your company
even managed to improve.
</p>
<</if>>

<p>
Expect <<reps $g.student>> classes to begin soon...
</p>


:: Quest_obedience_101Failure [nobr]

<p>
<<Yourrep $g.clerk1>> and <<utheirrel $g.clerk1 $g.clerk2>> <<rep $g.clerk2>>
were careless in their task, and information somehow leaked out that <<yourrep
$g.student>> student|is working for your slaving company. Given the <<rep
$company.humankingdom>>'s distate for slavery, the headmaster of the
institution simply could not accept your slaver as a candidate, and had to turn
the potential student away. But the explicit refusal only came after your slavers had
spent a great deal of money bribing their way through, and there was no way to
recoup these lost money...
