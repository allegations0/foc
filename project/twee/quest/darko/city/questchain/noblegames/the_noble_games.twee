:: Quest_the_noble_games [nobr]

<p>
Among the degenerate rich living in the <<lore region_city>>, there is an
infamous games played among them dubbed "The Noble Games". This is a series
of games hosted by a high noble, where the participants must demonstrate their
prowess in various disciplines, rather unorthodoxly. The winners are promised a
most salivating reward: a personal furniture directly from the noble's
bedchamber itself. Even if you don't plan to decorate your room, it will still
fetch for quite a large sum of money.
</p>

<p>
A new game has just started, and somehow you were able to gather information
about it. Apparently, the first game in this competition will test the
participant's wits â€” in order to win the first game, participants must
smuggle something interesting into a particular address in the city. It is up
to the participant's imagination what kind of contraband they want to smuggle
in, but whatever the contraband is, it will be returned to the participant at the conclusion
of the games.
</p>

<p>
Being a slaver company, there is only one contraband that you can reasonably
put in: a highly trained slave. Smuggling a slave into a slaver-averse city
full of guards will be a challenge though, let alone smuggling the slave
directly into the address in the center of the city.
Still, if you are willing to risk it, it's best to
send a team of three: a briber to make the guards look the other way, a
planner to plan your slavers' way in, and finally a thief to infiltrate the
mansion and drop the package in.
</p>

<p>
<<dangertextlite 'Warning'>>: This is a special challenge that will pit the
same team of slavers across multiple challenges. Make sure to send a
well-rounded team! Note that the slave you send on this mission will not be
gone... probably.
</p>

<<if $g.slave.isMale()>>
  <<questimage 'the_noble_games_male.jpg'>>
<<else>>
<</if>>

<p>
With <<their $g.planner>> preparations ready, your slavers
executed the plan drawn <<uadv $g.planner>> by <<rep $g.planner>>. <<Rep
$g.briber>> bribed your slavers' way into the mansion, with the guards
having to awkwardly look to the other way as your slavers brought in a cart
containing an totally normal sack of "grains". Eventually, your slavers
arrived safely at the address, on which a grand mansion stood.
</p>

<p>
<<Rep $g.thief>> got to work by
<<if $g.thief.isHasTrait('bg_assassin')>>
<<if $g.thief.isHasTrait('subrace_humansea')>>
using <<their $g.thief>> ninja technique and threw a grappling shuriken
<<else>>
recalling <<their $g.thief>> past as an assassin and
<<uadv $g.thief>> throwing a grappling hook
<</if>>
<<elseif $g.thief.isHasTrait('bg_thief')>>
recalling <<their $g.thief>> past as a common thief and
<<uadv $g.thief>> throwing a grappling hook
<<else>>
<<uadv $g.thief>> throwing a grappling hook
<</if>>
over to the open window on the second floor.
With the help of your other
slavers, <<rep $g.thief>> managed to transport the
<<if
$g.slave.isHasTraitExact('training_obedience_basic')>>struggling<<else>>compliant<</if>>
slave into the mansion. <<Rep $g.thief>> proceeded to dodge the various traps
and contraptions blocking <<their $g.thief>> way up and <<they $g.thief>>
made it to the innermost chambers.
</p>

<p>
<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
From the pristine look of the chamber, it seemed that your slavers were the
first one to arrive. Your slavers gagged and bound the poor slave <<rep
$g.slave>>, making sure <<they $g.slave>> couldn't produce any meaningful sound
to alert the guards. Once they did, they helped themselves to the valuables in
the room, which was understood as the extra prize for being the first to
complete the first bout of The Noble Games.
<<else>>
Apparently your slavers were not the first to complete this game, as several
out of place objects and slaves were already placed eye-catchingly in the room. It
seemed some other participants also have the same idea of smuggling in a
slave. Still, your slavers were confident that the quality of <<yourrep $g.slave>>
would carry them through.
<</if>>
</p>

<p>
A few days later, you receive a congratulary mail somehow delivered directly into your
fort, together with <<yourrep $g.slave>> nicely packaged with a ribbon. It seems
your slavers were successful in completing the first bout of The Noble Games.
</p>


:: Quest_the_noble_gamesFailure [nobr]

<p>
<<Rep $g.briber>> put <<their $g.briber>> trust in the wrong guards as one of
the guards pretended to accept the bribe, only to chase after the slavers
later down in the city.
<<if $gOutcome == 'failure'>>
Your slavers had to risk going a dangerous alley to
escape from the chase, getting injured in the process.
<<else>>
Your slavers had no choice but to leave their cargo
in the city as they escape the city.
<</if>>
</p>

<p>
Perhaps there will be another opportunity for another series of The Noble Games.
