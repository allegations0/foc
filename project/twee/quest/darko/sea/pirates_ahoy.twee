:: Quest_pirates_ahoy [nobr]

<p>
Pirates, Ahoy! If you ever wants to be a pirate, the <<lore region_sea>> might just
be the place you have been looking for. Raging water, hidden treasures, and
bountiful booties are abound as travelers from afar voyage often across the seas.
You can send a group of wannabe-pirates into the sea and pray they meet a
great ship to plunder, which can yield a lot of money as well as rare slaves
if done right.
</p>

<<if $g.victim.isMale()>>

<</if>>

<p>
Your slavers encountered a trading ship, who offered no resistance as your
slavers, led by <<rep $g.pirate1>>, <<uadv $g.pirate1>>
boarded and raided the entire ship.
They plundered the many valuables on the
ship as well as perusing the available booties before returning back to their
ship with a new slave <<rep $g.victim>>

<<set _att = setup.selectUnit([$g.pirate1, $g.pirate2, $g.navigator], {trait: 'per_attentive'})>>
<<if _att>>
  that <<rep _att>> had picked out of
<<else>>
  carefully chosen among
<</if>>

the many residents of the ship.
</p>


:: Quest_pirates_ahoySuccess [nobr]

<p>
Your slavers encountered a ship with only one passenger on tow.
<<They $g.victim>> offered no resistance as your slavers
<<uadv $g.pirate1>>
boarded and raided the ship, taking all the valuables on board as well as
the sole passenger <<themself $g.victim>> to be trained as a new slave back at the fort.
</p>


:: Quest_pirates_ahoyFailure [nobr]

<p>
Unfortunately, the <<lore region_sea>> are not for the faint-hearted pirates. Your
slavers were harried by a raging storm as soon as they departed, which
damaged most of their ship and forced them to retreat back into your fort
before even managing to venture deep into the waters.
</p>


:: Quest_pirates_ahoyDisaster [nobr]

<p>
Your slavers learned the hard way that it requires more than just brawn to be a good pirate.
They were assaulted by real pirates, and there was no chance that your slavers could defeat them.
Ultimately, your slavers surrendered to the pirates. The pirates proceeded to make use
of them for entertainment (being "bootified", as they put it)
before mercifully returning back to their ship after much debauchery,
but not before taking <<yourrep $g.pirate1>> as a prize.
</p>

<p>
<<Rep $g.pirate1>> will probably appear later in a slave auction on some land afar. You may be able to see <<them $g.pirate1>> again, if you're lucky.
