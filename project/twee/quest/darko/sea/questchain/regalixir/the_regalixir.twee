:: Quest_the_regalixir [nobr]

<p>
<<Yourrep $g.connected>> connected|is a well-connected <<urace
$g.connected>>, and <<their $g.connected>> connections even reach far beyond
the <<lore region_sea>>. <<They $g.connected>> connected|have found an
extremely rare opportunity for you: a lead into the rare and mysterious
concoction dubbed the Regalixir.
According to the stories, the Regalixir would awaken whatever dormant
potential sleeping within the lucky drinker. You could certainly use such a rare
potion for your own consumption.
</p>

<p>
The Regalixir is incredibly rare, however, and it is likely that <<dangertext
"you will never be able to obtain more than one in your entire career">>.
Furthermore, you also need to gather the instructions, as well as the rare
ingredients for the potion. Fortunately, <<rep $g.connected>> connected|have
gathered information that a famous alchemist in the <<lore region_sea>> happens to
be in possession of both, and it might be fruitful were you to send yourself
and a group of slavers to patron the alchemist.
</p>

<p>
It won't be easy though — you'd need a good alchemist to process the
information, as well as a good navigator to navigate the treacherous waters.
But above all else, you need money, and a lot of them. The alchemist won't
part with <<their $g.alc>> knowledge and ingredients for free, and they will
cost you quite a bit of fortune...
</p>

<p>
If your company is still not yet well-established, and has no such sum, then
it might be wise to come back to this quest later...
</p>


:: Quest_the_regalixirCrit [nobr]

<p>
Thanks to <<reps $g.navigator>> skills, you and your slavers arrived at the
alchemist's island — a quaint little island in the middle of nowhere. The
alchemist was a kindly <<woman $g.alchemist>>, who greeted your slavers and
offered some herbal teas during the talk. Hearing of your offer, and seeing
the amount of money you brought, <<they $g.alchemist>> <<uadv $g.alchemist>>
agreed to your request and shared <<their $g.alchemist>> knowledge with you
and your slavers.
<<if $unit.player.isHasTrait('skill_alchemy')>>

With your background in alchemy, you were able to understand and process all the information <<they $g.alchemist>> provides, making you feel good about yourself.

<<run setup.qc.BoonizeRandom('you', 10).apply($gQuest)>>

<<elseif $unit.player.isHasTrait('per_smart')>>

Despite having no background in alchemy, your keen intellect proved useful,
and you were able to digest most of the information <<they $g.alchemist>>
provides. It felt good.

<<run setup.qc.BoonizeRandom('you', 5).apply($gQuest)>>

<<else>>

Having no background whatsoever in alchemy, you put your trust in <<yourrep
$g.alchemist>> to jot down everything <<they $g.alchemist>> says.

<</if>>
In the end, <<rep $g.alchemist>> had a note full of the precise instructions
for making the potion.
</p>

<p>
After collecting the ingredients from the alchemist — including some things you'd never
know go into a potion — you and your slavers waved goodbye to the
portly alchemist and returned back to your fort in the ship. Time for the
next step: concocting the Regalixir itself!
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
<p>
Apparently, making the Regalixir requires you to have either slavers or
slaves possessing some special skills. You make a small detour during your
trip to capture a prospective slave, which should make it a little easier for
you to perform the ritual...
</p>
<</if>>


:: Quest_the_regalixirFailure [nobr]
<p>
You never arrived at the alchemist's island. Your ship was attacked by rowdy
pirates of the <<lore region_sea>>, and despite ending victorious in the ensuing battle,
you and your slavers suffer injuries. You <<uadv $unit.player>> ordered a
retreat, to recuperate back at your fort before trying again.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, this means all the money you brought along remained intact, and are put back into the treasury without a single coin lost. You imagine many coins would have been "lost" were you not personally attending to this quest...
</p>



:: Quest_the_regalixirDisaster [nobr]
<p>

You never arrive at the alchemist's island. Your ship was attacked by rowdy
pirates of the south, who emerged victorious against you. You were helpless
to do anything but watch as they discovered half of the money you stowed
along the ship, and moved them one crate at a time to their ship. Seeing the
wealth of money they had looted, the pirates "kindly" threw you a present
slave — a recent capture from one of their raiding trip, saying that it made
you even with them.
