<<Yourrep $g.handler>> did <<their $g.handler>> best to prepare <<rep $g.slave>> for the upcoming, final and most important fight.
<<They $g.handler>> was already familiar by the rules right now — barefisted, and the winner is decided by whoever fucked the loser first.
But for the final bout, instead of facefucking like all the previous rounds,
it is decided by assfucking instead.

<<include 'SouthernIslePitFightDescribeSlaver'>>

</p>

<p>
The opponent entered the right — a <<urace $g.enemy>> slave that was clearly good at fighting.
<<if $g.enemy.isHasTrait('subrace_dragonkin')>>
<<set _score = _score - 3>>
A dragonkin slave is incredibly rare, as well as incredibly powerful, which did not bode well for your slave.
<<elseif $g.enemy.isHasTrait('subrace_demon')>>
<<set _score = _score - 2>>
A demon slave is very rare, as well as possessing incredibly powers, which did not bode well for your slave.
<<elseif $g.enemy.isHasTrait('muscle_verystrong')>>
Bulging muscles covered <<their $g.enemy>> entire body.
<</if>>
<<if $g.enemy.isHasTrait('height_giant')>>
<<They $g.enemy>> towers over average <<urace $g.enemy>>.
<</if>>

<<Their $g.enemy>> <<uskin $g.enemy>> looks very tough, capable of withstanding much punishment.
<</if>>
<<if $g.enemy.isHasTrait('face_hideous')>>
<<Their $g.enemy>> face instills fear into lesser <<men $g.enemy>>.
<</if>>
<<if $g.enemy.isHasTrait('skill_ambidextrous')>>
<<They $g.enemy>> was a natural ambidex too, according to <<rep $g.handler>>.
<</if>>
<<if $g.enemy.isHasTrait('skill_intimidating')>>
<<They $g.enemy>> looked intimidating.
<</if>>
<<if $g.enemy.isHasTrait('per_dominant')>>
<<They $g.enemy>> exuded nothing but confidence.

Overall, <<rep $g.enemy>> was surely going to be a tough opponent...

<<if _score >= 7>>
<p>
Upon the referee's signal, the two combatants approached each other warily, both knowing the other was reasonably competent. Before long they were trading expert blows. <<Yourrep $g.slave>> was getting the worst of it, so <<they $g.slave>> decided to change the nature of the fight. After three tries, <<they $g.slave>> managed to bring the enemy to the ground, suffering a broken nose as <<they $g.slave>> did. The enemy <<urace $g.enemy>> tried to break the imperfect hold but only earned <<themself $g.enemy>> an elbow to the face. <<They $g.enemy>> was furious and <<rep $g.slave>> was obliged to wrench <<their $g.enemy>> <<uarms $g.enemy>> to the point of damage before <<they $g.slave>> allows <<them $g.enemy>> to go limp.

<p>
Upon the referee's signal, the two combatants approached each other warily, both knowing the other was reasonably competent. Before long they were trading expert blows. <<Yourrep $g.slave>> felt <<their $g.slave>> hits connecting, but unknown to <<them $g.slave>>, <<their $g.slave>> enemy decided to change the nature of the fight. After three tries, <<yourrep $g.slave>> was brought to the ground. <<They $g.slave>> tried to break the imperfect hold but only earned <<themself $g.slave>> an elbow to the face. <<They $g.slave>> was furious and the enemy was obliged to wrench <<their $g.slave>> <<uarms $g.slave>> to the point of damage before <<they $g.enemy>> allows <<them $g.slave>> to go limp.

<<set _winner = $g.enemy>>
<<set _loser = $g.slave>>

<<else>>

<p>
<<Yourrep $g.slave>> was clearly no match for the enemy, who opened the fight with a furious attack.
<<Rep $g.slave>> managed to get <<their $g.slave>> forearms up, blocking a few blows, but by doing so leaves <<their $g.slave>> abdomen open and obscures <<their $g.slave>> vision enough that <<they $g.slave>> slave|was unprepared for the following kidney strike, which brings <<them $g.slave>> gasping to one knee. The enemy let <<them $g.slave>> rise just a little before delivering a calculated hard right that sends <<them $g.slave>> to the floor for the easy win.
</p>

<<set _winner = $g.enemy>>
<<set _loser = $g.slave>>

<p>

<<if !_winner.isCanPhysicallyCum()>>
<<set _phallus = 'strap-on'>>
A strap-on was thrown down to the winner <<name _winner>>.
<<if _winner.isHasDick()>>
<<They _winner>> needed it, since <<their _winner>> caged cock won't be raping anything.
<</if>>
<<else>>
<<set _phallus = 'dick'>>
The winner, <<name _winner>>, took only a few moment to pump <<their _winner>> <<udick _winner>> a few times to get it to rock hardness.

<</if>>
<<They _winner>> then position <<their _winner>> <<= _phallus>> just before <<name _loser>>'s rear entrance.
</p>

<<if _winner.getMainTraining().getTags().includes('tr_dominance')>>
<p>
<<name _winner>> dominant tendencies mean that <<they _winner>> didn't have to feign willingness abuse and violate a slave. <<They _winner>> used the loser for <<their _winner>> pleasure, slapping <<them _loser>> cruelly, pinching <<them _loser>> until <<they _loser>> drew blood, and showing off for the spectators.
</p>
<<else>>
<p>
<<name _winner>> was so broken to slavery that <<they _winner>> enjoyed winning the fight and raping <<name _loser>>.
</p>
<</if>>

<<if _loser.isMasochistic()>>
<p>
<<name _loser>> got off to being beaten and molested, a true masochistic slut.
</p>
<</if>>

<<if _score >= 7>>
<<run setup.qc.VarSet('pit_fight_result', 'win', -1).apply($gQuest)>>

<p>
<<Yourrep $g.slave>> won the entire pit fights, and stepped into the podium to be awarded the champions title, as well as the <<rep setup.equipment.brawn_rear_master>>. While <<they $g.slave>> got to wear the rare equipment for now, you can always give it to one of your slavers later, if you wish.
</p>
<<elseif _score >= 4>>
<<run setup.qc.VarSet('pit_fight_result', 'second', -1).apply($gQuest)>>

<p>
Despite losing, <<rep $g.slave>> put up a good show, and the spectators greatly approved of the spectacle. <<They $g.slave>> was awarded the second-place prize money, while <<name $g.enemy>> was crowned champion and given the coveted <<rep setup.equipment.brawn_rear_master>>.
</p>
<<else>>
<<run setup.qc.VarSet('pit_fight_result', 'lose', -1).apply($gQuest)>>

<p>
Unfortunately, <<reps _loser>> show was so disappointing that the organized imposed a heavy penalty, taking away the slave to be "retrained" into a proper gladiator.

<</if>>

<</if>>

<<if $g.slave.isHasTrait('per_submissive')>>

<</if>>

<<if $g.slave.isHasTrait('per_masochistic')>>
<<Their $g.slave>> natural masochistic tendencies meant <<they $g.slave>> would reflexively put <<themself $g.slave>> in the most compromising positions...
<</if>>

<<if $g.slave.isHasTail()>>
<<Their $g.slave>> <<utail $g.slave>> remains stiff under the pressure.
<</if>>

<<if $g.slave.isHasTitle('quest_southern_isle_pit_fights_champion_0')>>

<<if $g.handler.isHasTrait('bg_mercenary')>>

<</if>>

<<if $g.handler.isHasTrait('bg_thug')>>
<<Their $g.handler>> past roughing up people on the streets gives <<them $g.handler>> knowledge in <<uhand $g.handler>>-to-<<uhand $g.handler>> combat.
<</if>>
