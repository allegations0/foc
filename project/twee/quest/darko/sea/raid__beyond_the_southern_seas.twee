:: Quest_raid__beyond_the_southern_seas [nobr]

<p>
There are several remote settlements on the <<lore region_sea>> —- these
settlements are rarely well-defended and hence make prime target for raiders
such as yourself. You could try to send a group of slavers to raid one such
settlement, but beware — like everything else in the <<lore region_sea>>, this
innocuous looking mission is sure to hide some unknown dangers...
</p>


:: Quest_raid__beyond_the_southern_seasCrit [nobr]

<p>
Your slavers, led by <<rep $g.raider1>>, were met with little resistance as
they raided their houses and raped the villagers.

<<set _raider = setup.selectUnit([$g.raider1, $g.raider2, $g.support], {trait: 'bg_raider'})>>
<<if _raider>>
  The raiding reminded <<rep _raider>> of <<their _raider>> past as a raider in the
  <<uhomeland _raider>>.
<</if>>

<<set _evil = setup.selectUnit([$g.raider1, $g.raider2, $g.support], {trait: 'per_evil'})>>
<<if _evil>>
  Seeing the devastation, <<rep _evil>> could not help but grin evilly.
<</if>>

<<set _cruel = setup.selectUnit([$g.raider1, $g.raider2, $g.support], {trait: 'per_cruel'})>>
<<if _cruel>>
  The cruelty satisfied <<reps _cruel>> sadistic tendencies.
<</if>>

In the end, they managed to
<<uadv $g.raider1>> plundered much of the village as well as kidnapped one particularly
valuable slave to bring home.
</p>


:: Quest_raid__beyond_the_southern_seasSuccess [nobr]

<p>
Your slavers, led by <<rep $g.raider1>>, managed to raid a remote part of a
remote village, meaning that there was really nobody who could have stopped
them. They <<uadv $g.raider1>> looted valuable jars and exotic rugs from the
warehouse and returned back to the ship before reinforcements come.
</p>


:: Quest_raid__beyond_the_southern_seasFailure [nobr]

<p>
Unfortunately, your slaver chose the wrong target as the warehouse they
targeted was apparently guarded by veteran mercenaries, who were able to
repel your slaver's assault with ease.
</p>


:: Quest_raid__beyond_the_southern_seasDisaster [nobr]

<p>
Your slavers were gravely injured as they foolishly attacked headlong into
a village square, which was obviously well defended by the fierce locals.
Worse, <<rep $g.support>> support|was captured by the locals, no doubt going to be made
example for your atrocities.
<<urescuenow $g.support>>.
