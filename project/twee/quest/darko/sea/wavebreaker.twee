:: Quest_wavebreaker [nobr]

<p>
As you recall, a certain master in the <<lore region_sea>> that calls
<<themself $g.master>> as the <<master $g.master>> of waves is offering to
buy your <<rep setup.trait.will_defiant>> slaves. This is a rare opportunity,
as no other slave-dealers would even bother dealing with these extremely
head-strong slaves.
</p>

<p>
You have the precise address of the <<master $g.master>> of waves, should you
wish to sell one of your slaves. It won't be difficult, but it will take some
time before your slavers can contact the
<<if $unit.player.isHasTrait('per_cruel')>>
tasteful
<<elseif $unit.player.isHasTrait('per_kind')>>
distasteful
<</if>>
<<man $g.master>>.
</p>



:: Quest_wavebreakerCrit [nobr]
<p>
Your slavers never met with the <<master $g.master>>, and all contact were
made through <<their $g.master>> head-slave, an oddly familiar <<urace
$g.slave>>. The slave was a little unnerving, seemingly completely broken to
<<their $g.slave>> <<master $g.master>>'s will.
As your slavers exited the mansion, the <<master $g.master>>'s slave reminded
your slavers that <<their $g.slave>> <<master $g.master>> is willing to make
at most one purchase per year.
</p>

<p>
Only when your slavers exited the mansion with the slave order did they
finally realize why the slave was so familiar â€” <<they $g.slave>> slave|is
one of the famous seven pirates of the <<lore region_sea>>, whose wanted
poster littered the cities back in the days.
It was believed that <<they $g.slave>> went missing
sometime ago, presumably dead, but your slavers know better now.
</p>


:: Quest_wavebreakerFailure [nobr]

<p>
Despite the obvious address of the <<master $g.master>>,
your slavers still managed to somehow get themselves lost in the vast <<lore region_sea>>.
Eventually, they returned to the dock, having exhausted their supplies for the journey.
You should try again with a better team.
</p>
