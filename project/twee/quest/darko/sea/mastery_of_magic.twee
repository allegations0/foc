<p>
You have always been gifted in the art of
<<rep _magic>>, which grants you some
control over <<= _magic.text().noun>>. When mastered, this domain of magic
would grant its wielder control over <<= _target.text().noun>>, which will
surely be beneficial for your career. Normally, it would be impossible for
anyone to increase their natural gift of using such magic. But you have heard
of a retired sage living across the <<lore region_sea>> who now spend most of <<their
$g.sage>> time helping others unlock their full mastery of their magic.
</p>

<p>
You could try to find the sage and seek to become <<their $g.sage>> pupil.
You will likely need to go alone however, and this endeavor will surely take
a really long time.

<<if !_magic>>
  <<dangertext 'You do not have any magic talent that can be improved further'>>
<<else>>

<p>
After finding the sage living alone in a secluded island, you <<uadv $g.you>>
implored the sage to teach you how to master your <<rep
_magic>>. Moved by your eagerness to learn, the sage took you as a student in
a mentorship that lasted for almost two months.
</p>

<p>
Within these two months, you learned so much about the nuances of your <<rep
_magic>> magic that you never know was always there.
You learned that
<<if _magic == setup.trait.magic_fire>>
<<lore magic_fire>> is capable than much more than simple
destruction —- With proper focus, you learned how to channel holy fire that can
drive away demons and corruptions alike like paladins of legends.
<<elseif _magic == setup.trait.magic_water>>
<<lore magic_water>> is so much more than simple nourishing
spells — Humanlike bodies are made of water after all, and it would only be
natural that control over water grants you control over shaping flesh.
<<elseif _magic == setup.trait.magic_wind>>
<<lore magic_wind>> is so much more than just controlling the flow of wind —
with proper focus, you can alter the shape of air itself and conjure
electricity out of nowhere, zapping foes and slaves alike.
<<elseif _magic == setup.trait.magic_earth>>
<<lore magic_earth>> can be so much more than just control over earth and
growth -- With proper focal point, you can focus the shapes and directions of
the growth creating tentacle aberrations like dark wizards of legends.
<<elseif _magic == setup.trait.magic_dark>>
<<lore magic_dark>> is so much more than simple concealment
tricks — When applied en masse, it could transform the body and minds of
others, corrupting them into darkness.
<<elseif _magic == setup.trait.magic_light>>
<<lore magic_light>> is so much more than just summoning blinding lights —
With the right mind and heart, it could be used to heal even the most severe
of wounds.
<</if>>
You spent the rest of the months practicing away your magic, unlocking the
hidden depths of talent you always have for them, but you never realized.
</p>

<p>
The two months you spent with the sage flied past like an arrow, and before
you knew it, you are now able to effortlessly
<<if _magic == setup.trait.magic_fire>>
summon purifying flames.
<<elseif _magic == setup.trait.magic_water>>
shape flesh.
<<elseif _magic == setup.trait.magic_wind>>
summon electricity.
<<elseif _magic == setup.trait.magic_earth>>
conjure tentacles.
<<elseif _magic == setup.trait.magic_dark>>
corrupt others.
<<elseif _magic == setup.trait.magic_light>>
heal others.
<</if>>
The tutelage at an end, you thanked your mentor for the two months of
guidance and finally headed back home to your family of slavers.
</p>
<</if>>

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>

<p>
It seemed that you have greatly impressed your mentor and <<they $g.sage>>
gave you an incredibly rare potion as a parting gift.
</p>

  implored the sage to teach you how to master your <<rep

  </p>

  <p>
  You underwent a rigorous studying regime under the mentorship, but even
  after all these hard work you did not feel as if your control over <<rep
  _magic>> had improve the slightest. Finally after two months of what felt
  like an eternity, you gave up and bid your mentor farewell before returning
  back home, the same person as you were before you begin the journey.
  </p>

<</if>>


:: Quest_mastery_of_magicDisaster [nobr]

<p>
Traveling alone in the <<lore region_sea>> turned out to be an incredibly foolish and dangerous
affair, as you learned the hard way. Your ship was attacked by
unspeakable creatures of the sea, which left you stranded alone in an
uninhabited island. It took you two months before you were rescued by your
slavers.
</p>
