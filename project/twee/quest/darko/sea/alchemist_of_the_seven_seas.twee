<p>
Wondrous potions are abound in the <<lore geo_mestia>> â€”
from simple potions that can heal wounds, to complex potions that can
erase memories or even restore the mind of mindbroken slaves.
While usually you have to resort to buying
these potions, now that you have <<rep setup.buildingtemplate.scoutharbor>>,
you can try to send an experienced alchemist <<rep
setup.trait.skill_alchemy>> across the ocean along with an entourage to
search for rare ingredients to be made into a potion. If successful, this
will no doubt gives you a rare potion that is worth a lot. But the sea is always
dangerous, especially for unprepared adventurers, and best to prepare for the worst.

<p>
The voyage went smoothly, and <<rep $g.navigator>> navigator|was able to
<<uadv $g.navigator>>
lead the ship into multiple islands for <<rep $g.biologist>> and <<rep $g.alchemist>>
to hunt for ingredients.

<<set _lizardkin = setup.selectUnit([$g.biologist, $g.alchemist, $g.navigator], {anytrait: [
  'subrace_lizardkin',
  'subrace_dragonkin',
  'subrace_humansea',
]})>>
<<if _lizardkin>>
  Some of the islands were familiar to <<rep _lizardkin>> -- <<therace _lizardkin>> helped the team
  with naming some of the floras in those islands.
<</if>>

<<set _curious = setup.selectUnit([$g.biologist, $g.alchemist, $g.navigator], {trait: 'per_curious'})>>
<<if _curious>>
  <<Rep _curious>> curiously poked the many strange plants <<they _curious>> had never seen before.
<</if>>

In the end, <<rep $g.alchemist>> alchemist|was able to find and use many rare ingredients to
concoct two very special potions.

<p>
The voyage wasn't easy, but through <<reps $g.navigator>> persistence and
<<reps $g.alchemist>> skill, they were able to
<<uadv $g.navigator>>
return with one vial of an extremely rare potion in hand.
This potion will surely come in handy for the company's future endeavors.
Alternatively, you can always sell it for a tidy sum
<<inyourbuilding 'bazaar'>>.

:: Quest_alchemist_of_the_seven_seasFailure [nobr]

<p>
While landing on one of the many islands in the <<lore region_sea>>, your slavers
were ambushed by local feral animals and had to retreat back to the ship after sustaining
debilitating injuries.
</p>


:: Quest_alchemist_of_the_seven_seasDisaster [nobr]
<p>
<<Yourrep $g.alchemist>> got too excited with the many rare ingredients <<they $g.alchemist>> found,
 and mixed them incorrectly, resulting in a large explosion in the ship's makeshift laboratory.
 <<Rep $g.alchemist>> and <<utheirrel $g.alchemist $g.biologist>> <<rep $g.biologist>> sustained life-threatening
 injuries and need to be treated and rested immediately.
