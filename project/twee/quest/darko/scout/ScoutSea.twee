:: QuestScoutSea [nobr]
<p>
It is said that beyond the southern seas, there are land much unlike our own.
You have several leads in those lands from your contact, but
they must be followed immediately or they will be gone.
Via your harbor, you can send your slavers there on a ship,
but the journey will take a long time.
Furthermore, the southern seas is dangerous and unpredictable, and
the scout guard will be placed at the riskiest position in such a journey.
</p>

:: QuestScoutSeaCrit [nobr]
<p>
The scouting mission was a complete success, with your team returning with more
quest options than expected.
</p>

:: QuestScoutSeaSuccess [nobr]
<p>
The scouting mission went about as well as expected, and your team returned with
several quest options.
</p>

:: QuestScoutSeaFailure [nobr]
<p>
Your slavers returned bearing injuries. They say that the ship were attacked
by some beast of other world. While the injuries are actually light, your slavers
seem to have been affected by such a severe trauma that it is best to give them
some time to rest now.
</p>

:: QuestScoutSeaDisaster [nobr]
<p>
Only two of your slavers returned. They tell the story that the ship were
attacked by some horrific being of other world. They were only able to return thanks to
<<rep $g.guard>>, who sacrificed his life and his body to buy them
time to steer the ship back to your port.
