:: QuestRecruitmentSea [nobr]

<p>
The <<lore geo_mestia>> is not the only continent in the world.
Many people live far across the <<lore region_sea>> -- people with cultures
unlike any other you have probably ever seen.
There are hulking <<rep setup.trait.subrace_lizardkin>>
going on their everyday life there, as well as the rare and elusive
<<rep setup.trait.subrace_dragonkin>>.
These scaled people are known to be proficient in many field.
Furthermore, there are also many <<rep setup.trait.subrace_humansea>>,
perhaps most famous for their hypnotic dances.
They would make excellent slavers, if you are willing to shell out the resources
to find and hire them.
</p>

<p>
This quest is available thanks to your <<rep setup.buildingtemplate.hiringsquaresea>>.
</p>


:: QuestRecruitmentSeaCrit [nobr]

<p>
<<Reps $g.recruiter1>> and <<reps $g.recruiter2>> trip across the sea
borne fruit, as they were very successful in their trip and managed to find
seven potential slavers for your company.
These recruits from faraway lands are now waiting in the prospects hall for your
decision, and need to be paid should you want to hire them.
</p>


:: QuestRecruitmentSeaSuccess [nobr]

<p>
Your recruiters <<rep $g.recruiter1>> and <<rep $g.recruiter2>> sailed across
the sea in search of comrades and managed to find four potential slavers.
They are now awaiting your decision in the prospects hall.
</p>


:: QuestRecruitmentSeaFailure [nobr]

<p>
The seas were unkind to your slavers during their journey -- your slavers
shipped were washed ashore during one of the storms.
They spent most of their hiring money for fixing their boat instead, and only managed
to find one potential recruit to bring back home.
</p>


:: QuestRecruitmentSeaDisaster [nobr]

<p>
Unfortunately, your slavers' trip to the <<lore region_sea>> got cut short when
a kraken attacked their ship, forcing them to retreat early to your fort.
</p>
