:: Quest_friendsofthe_forest [nobr]

<p>
The western forests are inhabited by both <<rep setup.trait.subrace_elf>> and
<<rep setup.trait.subrace_neko>>. People of these races have
the potential to make an excellent slavers: Nekos often make great
entertainers, making them suitable for negotiation missions, while elves
are often gifted in the art of healing, making them excellent as support.
</p>

<p>
Both of these races have practiced slavery for a long time, and it would not
be too difficult to send a group of slavers to recruit some of these people into your
company. Your slavers need to bring a little incentive though in order to
entice the candidates into your fort.
</p>

<p>
This quest is available thanks to your <<rep setup.buildingtemplate.hiringsquareforest>>.
</p>


:: Quest_friendsofthe_forestCrit [nobr]

<p>
The team's recruiters: <<rep $g.recruiter1>> and <<rep $g.recruiter2>>, told
a great many raunchy stories about their exciting journey as slavers,
together with the benefits of having a slave, and managed to entice seven
potential slavers to come to your fort. They are now awaiting your decision
in the <<rep setup.buildingtemplate.prospectshall>>.
</p>


:: Quest_friendsofthe_forestSuccess [nobr]

<p>
The team's recruiters: <<rep $g.recruiter1>> and <<rep $g.recruiter2>>,
scoured through the forest looking for specific types of people they believed would
make great slavers. Your slavers promised them bountiful flesh in addition to
gold if they join, which resulted in 4 potential slavers now patiently waiting
your decision in the <<rep setup.buildingtemplate.prospectshall>>.
</p>


:: Quest_friendsofthe_forestFailure [nobr]
<p>
Your slavers stopped by in the first tavern they found and spent almost all of
their time getting drunk. Still, they managed to convince a random drink-mate
they befriended in the tavern to join them back home.
</p>


:: Quest_friendsofthe_forestDisaster [nobr]
<p>
It seems you have chosen the wrong unit for the mission, as neither <<rep $g.recruiter1>> nor <<rep $g.recruiter2>> were able to convince anyone of the benefits of being a slaver. Nobody joined them on their trip back home.
</p>
