:: QuestForestContact [nobr]

<p>
Building <<rep setup.buildingtemplate.scouttower>> is not enough to start doing
quests in the <<lore region_forest>>. You also need
to find some promising contacts in the <<lore region_forest>> who might
be willing to send to your company quest leads, among the
elves and the neko living in the forest.
</p>

:: QuestForestContactCrit [nobr]

<p>
Your slavers happened upon a rather unscrupulous elf, who is willing
to supply your company with leads in exchange for the occasional visits to your
fort to enjoy the provided "entertainments".
</p>

:: QuestForestContactFailure [nobr]
<p>
Unfortunately, you failed to find any such contact. You should try again.
