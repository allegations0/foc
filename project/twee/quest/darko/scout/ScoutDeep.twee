:: QuestScoutDeep [nobr]

<p>
Your settlement contact within the <<lore region_deep>> has sent you several potential
leads for jobs your company could take down there.
Your slavers would need two weeks to follow up on these leads, should you wish to pursue them.
As <<lore region_deep>> is infested with monsters, you'd best ensure that even your scouts
know how to fight.
</p>

:: QuestScoutDeepCrit [nobr]

<p>
The scouting mission was a complete success, with your team returning with more
quest options than expected.
</p>

:: QuestScoutDeepSuccess [nobr]

<p>
The scouting mission went about as well as expected, and your team returned with
several quest options.
</p>

:: QuestScoutDeepFailure [nobr]

<p>
Your slavers were overwhelmed by a group of
<<if $gQuest.getSeed() % 5 == 0>>
giant spiders,
<<elseif $gQuest.getSeed() % 5 == 1>>
basilisks,
<<elseif $gQuest.getSeed() % 5 == 2>>
dark slimes,
<<elseif $gQuest.getSeed() % 5 == 3>>
giant rats,
<<elseif $gQuest.getSeed() % 5 == 4>>
bloodworms,
<</if>>
and
<<if $gOutcome == 'failure'>>
suffered minor injuries.
<<else>>
suffered injuries.
<</if>>
They wisely decided to return back, although that also means they were unable to pursue
any of the quest leads.
</p>
