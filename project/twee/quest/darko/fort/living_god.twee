:: Quest_living_godCrit [nobr]
<p>

The small shrine has finally been erected.
<<if $gOutcome == 'failure'>>
Your slavers may have chosen a more expensive material than needed (costing you a fair amount of gold, by the way), but it's done.
<<elseif $gOutcome == 'disaster'>>
Your slavers may have been too inspired with the task, and chose the rarest of materials to construct the shrine (costing you a ludicrous amount of gold, by the way), but it's all done.
<</if>>
The shrine is quite eye-catching â€” visible directly from the bustling <<rep
setup.buildingtemplate.market>> of your fort.
Within its sanctum, lies a statue much like <<yourrep $g.god>>,
posed in a
<<uadjgood $g.god>> pose.
The shrine soonafter attracts many people from <<rep $g.god.getHomeCompany()>>, who comes to worship your slaver.
<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
In fact, some nearby villagers from the <<lore region_vale>> already come to visit, and they were much impressed by <<reps $g.god>> heavenly <<ubody $g.god>>.
<</if>>
</p>

<p>
Before <<they $g.god>> god|begin the "sermons", however, perhaps you could direct <<them $g.god>> to hold them in a particular direction...
