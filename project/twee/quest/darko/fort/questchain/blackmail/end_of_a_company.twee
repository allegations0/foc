:: Quest_end_of_a_company [nobr]
<p>
Through your efforts in the past few weeks, your rival slaving company leader
<<rep $g.boss>> had seen many of <<their $g.boss>> <<women $g.boss>> deserted
or simply disappeared for one reason or another. With only a few slavers under
<<their $g.boss>> employ, the time has finally come should you with to launch
an attack into <<their $g.boss>> fort, rescuing <<yourrep $g.slaver>>.
</p>

<p>
As you want to savor the result yourself, you are planning to go personally
on this mission. But you also need two other slavers to accompany you.
Assaulting the fort directly will be dangerous, so best prepare yourselves.
</p>


:: Quest_end_of_a_companyCrit [nobr]

<p>
After some careful preparation, you managed to find a particular time
where the few of <<reps $g.boss>> remaining slavers were away from the fort.
Seizing the opportunity, you led <<yourrep $g.dps>> and <<rep $g.healer>> on a
frontal assault. With no slavers left to defend the fort, your slavers'
assault were not met with any meaningful resistance, and before long you found yourself
deep inside the enemy fort, looking up to the office where <<rep $g.boss>> must
reside in.
</p>

<p>
Inside the fort, you and your slavers dispatched the remaining slavers who
were caught in surprise, since nobody alerted them of your presence.
Downing slaver after slaver, you finally arrived at what appears to be the
leader's office. You <<uadv $g.you>> kicked the door open, before finally
coming face to face with your rival who had been black-mailing you all the
past few weeks. <<Their $g.boss>> eyes cast downwards, <<they $g.boss>> knew
<<they $g.boss>> boss|was defeated, but still managed to tempt you with one
final offer...
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
<p>
Seeing the boss secured, <<yourrep $g.dps>> sneaked back from the room, and
managed to grab a particularly valuable-looking former slaver to bring home
as a slave.
</p>
<</if>>



:: Quest_end_of_a_companyFailure [nobr]

<p>
You did not manage to choose the right time for the assault. By the time you
arrived at the fort, one of <<their $g.boss>> remaining slavers spotted you
from atop the fort, alerting the entire fort to your presence. There was no
hope of you and your slavers to successfully invade a well-alerted fort, so
you <<uadv $g.you>> ordered a retreat to fight another day. Fortunately,
<<rep $g.boss>> seemed unaware that it was you who launched the attack, and
assumed it to be the desperate act of some random bandit...
</p>


:: Quest_end_of_a_companyDisaster [nobr]

<p>
Your rival company leader is not a dumb <<man $g.boss>>, and it showed. In
anticipation of attacks, <<they $g.boss>> had carefully lined up layers after
layers of traps surrounding <<their $g.boss>> fort â€” traps you and your slavers
fell victim to. Sustaining injuries, you and your slavers were forced to
retreat and re-plan the attack for another day.
</p>
