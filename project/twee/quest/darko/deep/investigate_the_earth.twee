<p>
    After the latest earthquake, a suspicious and mysterious cavern
    has opened up at your fort's open yard, leading downwards.
    You start to suspect that it might not be a regular earthquake. Something, or perhaps someone down below is causing it, and it might be in your best interest to investigate.
</p>

<<questimage "deeprealm.jpg">>

<p>
    Your trio of slavers prepared themselves for braving the unknown below.
    <<Rep $g.sur>> would lead the expedition, while <<rep $g.fighter>> and <<rep $g.support>> would tag along just in case something dangerous appeared.
</p>

<p>
    After nodding to each other, they jumped into the hole, and into the dark underneath. Lighting the torch reveals a sizeable caverns, leading even deeper downwards. Your trio of slavers slowly followed along the dark and damp tunnels, into the unknown...
</p>

<p>
    The tunnel got smaller, and your slavers were forced to crawl on all fours to continue.
    Amidst the dank smell of the place (or was it <<reps $g.fighter>> ass thats right in front of <<reps $g.support>> face?), <<rep $g.sur>> suddenly felt a breeze of wind. Before long the source is revealed as the tunnel opens to an open space, an underground highway of sort. And your slavers were not alone.
</p>

<p>
    A bunch of tiny lizardkin could be seen busily repairing parts of a collapsed wall. Despite being tiny, they work fast and efficiently, hammering the walls back into shape. It seems you have found the cause for your tremor — your fort is just right above the highway, and their repairs must have caused tremors upwards.
</p>

<p>
    Inspecting them closer, <<rep $g.sur>> finally realized that these are no lizardkin. They are kobolds, who apparently has made the underworld their home. A thriving kobold civilization seems to exist down here, and who knows what else.
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit' || $gOutcome == 'success'>>
    <p>
        Sensing no danger, your slavers came in with their hands open.
        The kobolds were surprised, naturally, but soon relaxed as <<rep $g.sur>>
        made it clear that they came without harm, and was just investigating the cause of the ruckus.
        <<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
            Looking for a gift, <<rep $g.sur>> rummaged <<their $g.sur>> backpack trying to find something, until <<they $g.sur>> realized the kobolds were intently looking at <<their $g.sur>> leftover breakfast.
            Indeed, it seems surface food is quite rare here, and <<rep $g.sur>> <<uadv $g.sur>> gave it to the kobolds as a gesture of goodwill.
        <</if>>
    </p>
<<else>>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, the kobolds mistook your slavers for enemies, and took fighting positions.
        These kobolds are builders, however, and they were no match for <<reps $g.fighter>> prowess in combat. Still, it seemed that you have left a negative first impression on these kobolds.
    </p>
<</if>>

<p>
    In the next few days, your slavers managed to learn much about the world below — the <<lore region_deep>>, as the kobolds put it.
    <<if $g.sur.isHasTrait('bg_scholar')>>
        The bookworm <<rep $g.sur>> already knows about it from one of the books <<they $g.sur>> read in <<their $g.sur>> past job as a scholar.
    <<elseif $g.sur.isHasTrait('per_studious')>>
        The studious <<rep $g.sur>> already knows about it from one of the books <<they $g.sur>> read in your library.
    <<else>>
        <<Rep $g.sur>> seemed to recall reading something like that in the library, but it was not very clear.
    <</if>>
    Still, it seems that your fort just happens to be right above the place, which means should you excavate the tunnel properly into an entrance (by building the <<rep setup.buildingtemplate.scouttunnel>>), you could explore the <<lore region_deep>>.
    Who knows what kind of interesting creatures the realm hold?
