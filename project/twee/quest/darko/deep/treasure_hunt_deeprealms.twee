:: Quest_treasure_hunt_deeprealms [nobr]
<p>
    The <<lore region_deep>> is connected by ancient highways, build by civilization of old that have been long lost to time.
    Some of the highways remain present and well-used to this day, especially for trading between the subterran settlements. Many, however, lies decrepit, inhabited by monsters of many kinds.
    The <<lore region_deep>> citizens believe that many treasures are hidden behind those ruins, should one be foolish enough to venture into the unknown, risking their lives for a meager sum of gold...

<p>
    Having identified a pristine and unlooted location deep from a tavern in the <<lore region_deep>>,
    your slavers <<uadv $g.scholar>> braved the dangers of the <<lore region_deep>> on the way there. And there was quite a number of monsters along the way.
    First was the giant spiders, whom
    <<rep $g.fighter>>
    <<if $g.fighter.isHasTrait('magic_fire')>>
        burned with fire.
    <<elseif $g.fighter.isHasTrait('skill_ambidextrous')>>
        slayed with <<their $g.fighter>> dual wielding technique.
    <<elseif $g.fighter.isHasTrait('magic_water')>>
        froze in ice.
    <<elseif $g.fighter.isHasTrait('magic_light')>>
        blinded with light.
    <<else>>
        slayed with <<their $g.fighter>> <<uweapon $g.fighter>>.
    <</if>>
    There was also the horde of undead, whom
    <<rep $g.healer>>
    <<if $g.healer.isHasTrait('magic_light')>>
        cleansed with the power of the light.
    <<elseif $g.healer.isHasTrait('magic_fire')>>
        purified with the power of the fire.
    <<elseif $g.healer.isHasTrait('magic_water')>>
        froze in place.
    <<elseif $g.healer.isHasTrait('skill_alchemy')>>
        purified with a purifying concoction.
    <<else>>
        bashed repeatedly in the head with <<their $g.healer>> <<uweapon $g.healer>>.
    <</if>>
    And there were much more your slavers defeated in order to reach the supposed treasure-bearing location.
</p>

<<if $gQuest.getSeed() % 4 == 0>>
    <p>
        The ruins your slavers stumbled upon turned out to be an ancient treasury of some sort.
    </p>

    <<if $gOutcome == 'failure' || $gOutcome == 'disaster'>>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, all of the treasures has been lost to time.
        </p>
    <<else>>
        <p>
            Most of the treasures have been lost to time, but there was an exceptionally durable pieces of ancient dwarven armor which survived the test of the ages.
        </p>
        <<run setup.qc.Equipment('dwarf_armor').apply($gQuest)>>
    <</if>>

            <<if $g.scholar.isHasTrait('per_attentive')>>
                being the attentive <<urace $g.slaver>>,
            <<else>>
                by pure chance,
            <</if>>
            spotted a few trap triggers littering the place, indicating that the treasure was not fully unguarded.
            Thanks to the detection, they were able to navigate through it, and obtained the armor without injuries.
        </p>
    <<else>>
        <p>
            But the treasury was not completely unguarded.
            A false step, and <<rep $g.fighter>> triggered an ancient dwarven defense mechanism, firing deadly arrows throughout the area.
            Your slavers suffered
            <<if $gOutcome == 'disaster'>>
                massive
            <</if>>
            injuries as a result.
        </p>
        <<if $gOutcome == 'disaster'>>
            <<run setup.qc.Injury('fighter', 6).apply($gQuest)>>

        <</if>>
    <</if>>

<<elseif $gQuest.getSeed() % 4 == 1>>
    <p>
        The place turns out to be a catacomb, a final resting place for people of ancient times.
        <<if $gOutcome == 'failure' || $gOutcome == 'disaster'>>
            To make things worse, the place seems to have already been looted clean, with no treasure whatsoever in sight.
        <<else>>
            But it is also brimming with treasure unlooted from long past, which your slavers <<uadv $g.scholar>> looted clean.
            <<run setup.qc.Money(6000).apply($gQuest)>>
        <</if>>
    </p>

    <p>
        <<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
            Nothing bad seems to happen â€” it seems whatever spirit used to haunt these halls have also long been lost to time.
        <<else>>
            However, the catacombs were not as abandoned as your slavers had thought. It seems your slavers had angered the spirits who remained there, who
            <<if $gOutcome == 'disaster'>>
                cursed all your slavers for their desecration of the sacred place...
                <<run setup.qc.Blessing('fighter', 1, null, true).apply($gQuest)>>
                <<run setup.qc.Blessing('healer', 1, null, true).apply($gQuest)>>

            <<else>>
                cursed
                <<if $gQuest.getSeed() % 3 == 0>>
                    <<set $g.o = $g.fighter>>
                <<elseif $gQuest.getSeed() % 3 == 1>>
                    <<set $g.o = $g.healer>>
                <<elseif $gQuest.getSeed() % 3 == 2>>
                    <<set $g.o = $g.scholar>>
                <</if>>
                <<rep $g.o>>
                for the desceration...
                <<run setup.qc.Blessing('unit', 1, null, true).apply(setup.costUnitHelper($g.o))>>
            <</if>>
        <</if>>
    </p>

<<elseif $gQuest.getSeed() % 4 == 2>>
    <p>
        The place turns out to be the remains of a temple, although ravaged by time.
        <<if $gOutcome == 'failure' || $gOutcome == 'disaster'>>
            Whatever power it used to have, it has been long gone.
        <<else>>
            The temple was still brimming with power, bestowing blessings upon blessings on two of your slavers.
            <<run setup.qc.Blessing('fighter', 1).apply($gQuest)>>
            <<run setup.qc.Blessing('healer', 1).apply($gQuest)>>
        <</if>>
    </p>

    <p>
        <<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
            With the last brim of power absorbed into your slavers, the temple crumbled to the ground, its eternal service seemingly at an end.
        <<else>>
            Being so deep within the infested <<lore region_deep>> has corrupted the temple, however, and in addition to the blessings, it also grant
            <<if $gOutcome == 'disaster'>>
                great
                <<run setup.qc.TraumatizeRandom('fighter', 30).apply($gQuest)>>

            <<else>>
                <<run setup.qc.TraumatizeRandom('fighter', 12).apply($gQuest)>>
                <<run setup.qc.TraumatizeRandom('healer', 12).apply($gQuest)>>
                <<run setup.qc.TraumatizeRandom('scholar', 12).apply($gQuest)>>
            <</if>>
            trauma upon your slavers...
        <</if>>
    </p>

<<elseif $gQuest.getSeed() % 4 == 3>>

    <p>
        The place turns out to be a demonic altar, and seemingly rather recently built too.
        <<if $gOutcome == 'failure' || $gOutcome == 'disaster'>>
            It seems to have already completed its purpose, however, and nothing of value was found.
        <<else>>
            In fact, on top of the altar lies a single writhing slave, whom your slavers freed only to enslave right after.
            <<run setup.qc.Slave('slave').apply($gQuest)>>
        <</if>>
    </p>

    <p>
        <<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
            Thankfully, there was no repercussion whatsoever of intruding into such corrupted ritual. Your slavers had to count their lucks for that.
        <<else>>
            On the way back, however, the altar suddenly reactivated, seemingly on its own.
            Dark corrupted tendrils shot out,
            <<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
                <<run setup.qc.Corrupt('fighter', 2).apply($gQuest)>>
                <<run setup.qc.Corrupt('healer', 2).apply($gQuest)>>
                greatly
            <<else>>
                corrupting your slavers...
                <<run setup.qc.Corrupt('fighter').apply($gQuest)>>
                <<run setup.qc.Corrupt('healer').apply($gQuest)>>
