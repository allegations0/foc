<p>
    The drow are cunning, cruel, and generally mistrustful people. This is not to say all drow are the same, but their upbringing, the <<lore culture_drowriteofadulthood>>, as well as the harsh nature of the <<lore region_deep>> they live ensures that only the willful survive and the weak perish. This makes it awkward to befriend them — how could one possibly gain the trust of such mistrustful people?
</p>

<p>
    Well, the answer is you don't. Or at least, you don't do it like you normally would. The only reliable way is by blackmailing them, and you have the lead for that too. One of the most prominent families in <<rep $company.drow>> is going to be away for a few days, making their mansion ripe for infiltration. Who knows what secrets they might be holding inside?
</p>

<p>
    Just make sure that whoever you send on the mission do not get caught in the attempt...
</p>


:: Quest_secret_sellerCrit [nobr]
<p>
    The mansion in question was indeed lightly guarded, but it was by no means not heavily guarded. <<Rep $g.distractor>> swayed seductively, distracting the head guard just enough for <<rep $g.snooper1>> and <<rep $g.snooper2>> to snoop in.
</p>

<p>
    There are guards stationed even inside — a surefire tell that some secret must be hidden underneath.
    Your slavers just have to sneak in very carefully to not draw unwanted attention.
    <<if $g.snooper1.isHasTrait('height_dwarf')>>
        A task made easier by <<reps $g.snooper1>> miniscule height.
    <</if>>
    <<if $g.snooper1.isHasTrait('height_tall')>>
        A task made harder by <<reps $g.snooper1>> tall height.
    <</if>>
    <<if $g.snooper1.isHasTrait('tough_nimble')>>
        <<Rep $g.snooper1>> snooper1|is nimble enough to dodge through the more obvious traps.
    <</if>>
    <<if $g.snooper1.isHasTrait('tough_tough')>>
        <<Rep $g.snooper1>> snooper1|is not the most flexible slaver, and had to struggle getting past some of the obvious traps.
    <</if>>
    <<if $g.snooper1.isHasTrait('per_aggressive')>>
        <<Rep $g.snooper1>> snooper1|is impatient, making it more likely that your slavers will get caught.
    <</if>>
    <<if $g.snooper1.isHasTrait('per_calm')>>
        <<Rep $g.snooper1>> snooper1|is patient, a critical trait needed for missions like this.
    <</if>>
    <<if $g.snooper1.isHasTrait('magic_light')>>
        <<Reps $g.snooper1>> mastery of light magic backfires as it occasionally leave glowing trail behind <<their $g.snooper1>> wake.
    <</if>>
    <<if $g.snooper1.isHasTrait('magic_dark')>>
        <<Rep $g.snooper1>> would use <<their $g.snooper1>> dark magic to shroud their presence, making it easier to sneak to the innermost chamber.
    <</if>>
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'success' || $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
    <p>
        It took some time, but your slavers were able to sneak in undetected to the innermost chambers. From the looks of it, it looks like a regular torture chamber — manacles hanging from the ceiling as well as numerous sex toys littering the place. But something is definitely off.
        Looking around, not a single slave were found. In fact, there was no slave cells at all. What could the family has use of these for?
    </p>
    <p>
        The answer comes to light as your slavers look at the sex toys and the chains closer. Some of them has traces of the very distinct drow skin coloration — did the drows use these on themselves? Their suspicions were confirmed as they found more and more evidence around the place. As proof, they took one of the most well used sex toys to bring home — a piece of undeniable blackmail material.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once your slavers returned home with the story, you contacted the drow family in question, discreetly saying you know where their sex toy might have gone missing to.
        <<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
            With a winning grin, you flash a mention of a lost sex toy, and the drows were almost willing to do anything to prevent the devastating news from spreading. They agree to be a stalwart ally to your company, although you also sense a hint of anger and ire coming from them. Still, you count this as a success in your book.
        <<else>>
            Despite this, however, the drow remained stubborn, denying almost everything. Still, you could sense that they were trying to appease you, and you most certainly have gained their favor, although perhaps also their ire at the same time. All in all, mission successful.
        <</if>>
    </p>
<<else>>
    <p>
        <<if $gQuest.getSeed() % 2 == 0>>
            <<set $g.o = $g.snooper1>>
        <<elseif $gQuest.getSeed() % 2 == 1>>
            <<set $g.o = $g.snooper2>>
        <</if>>
        But <<rep $g.o>> o|was careless, and triggered one of the traps.
        <<if $gOutcome == 'disaster'>>
            A trap door opened, swallowing <<rep $g.o>> whole.
        <<else>>
            Poison arrows fired out of nowhere, injuring both your slavers.
        <</if>>
        In the end, the surviving slavers managed to return back, but the drows know it was your doing. And the drows do not forget.
    </p>

    <<if $gOutcome == 'disaster'>>
        <p>
            <<uneedrescue $g.o>>, perhaps from one of the many slave mines operated by the drows...
        </p>
    <</if>>
<</if>>
