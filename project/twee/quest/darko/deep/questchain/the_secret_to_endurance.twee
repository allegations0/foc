:: Quest_the_secret_to_endurance [nobr]
<p>
    You have been patroning <<rep $g.they>>, the master endurance trainer in <<rep $company.drow>>, quite a few times by now.
    In between the patronage, you have learned about <<their $g.they>> humble (well, not really) abode — a mansion in the outskirts of <<rep $company.drow>>. In the drow community, information is power, and perhaps you could use this information to gain leverage on the drow...
</p>

<p>
    You could send a group of slavers to try and infiltrate the mansion.
    Who knows what you might find there, but one thing is for sure — all drows keep a secret, one you'll about to find out!
</p>


:: Quest_the_secret_to_enduranceCrit [nobr]
<p>
    For a drow mansion, the mansion is surprisingly lightly guarded. In the middle of the night, your slavers sneaked into the back door, and <<rep $g.thief>> picked the lock and let your slavers in.
    For a drow, the interior looks remarkably humble — no big painting of a closeup of <<their $g.they>> nose, nor a grand statue of <<their $g.they>> own likeliness. Something... was off.
</p>

<p>
    Your slavers scoured the interior for secrets, until <<rep $g.infiltrator1>> accidentally stumbled into a book. On a closer inspection, it turned out to be... a diary? It seems, to your complete luck, the drow keeps a diary, which surely contains numerous secrets...
</p>

<p>
    The diary contains some mundane stuffs for sure, like the number of slaves trained per day. However, going back a few pages, just when the drow was first acquintanced with your slaving company, you found something... very revealing.
</p>

<div class='lettercard'>
    <p>
        Dear diary,
    </p>
    <p>
        A most lucrative company has come today to ask for my services. They say they are a slaving company... <<rep $company.player>> if I am not mistaken. And I could not get it out of my head. They must employ many dominant <<master $unit.player>>s. Would they be able to deliver me my deepest wish? I just want to experience, just once, how it feels to be dominated...
    </p>
    <p>
        But alas, it is in a cruel world we live in. The drows do not tolerate even a moment of weakness, and hence this dream will remain such. A dream...
    </p>
</div>

<p>
    This is a clear as day blackmail material. With this in your hand,
    <<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
        as well as a pony gear your slavers nabbed inside the manse,
    <</if>>
    you now have a couple of options to consider...
</p>





:: Quest_the_secret_to_enduranceFailure [nobr]
<p>
    Unfortunately, your slavers were discovered skulking around the mansion. They managed to escape unharmed, but they were already identified. Your reputation with the drow suffered as a result.
</p>



:: Quest_the_secret_to_enduranceDisaster [nobr]
<<if $gQuest.getSeed() % 3 == 0>>
    <<set $g.o = $g.infiltrator1>>
<<elseif $gQuest.getSeed() % 3 == 1>>
    <<set $g.o = $g.infiltrator2>>
<<elseif $gQuest.getSeed() % 3 == 2>>
    <<set $g.o = $g.thief>>
<</if>>

<p>
    Unfortunately, your slavers were caught red-handed trying to sneak into the drow mansion.
    Knowing that the punishment is nothing short of slavery, your slavers tried to make the run for it.
    Two of them succeed, but <<rep $g.o>> got shot down with a spell of dark bolting.
    <<uneedrescue $g.o>>, before the drows press the poor <<urace $g.o>> into the mines permanently...
</p>
