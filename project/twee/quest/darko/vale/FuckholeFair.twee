:: QuestFuckholeFair [nobr]

<p>
One of the northern settlements is holding a festival! Everyone is
welcome to bring any attraction to the festival -- the attendees
would often pay in order to make use of the available attractions.
Somehow, your company was also invited to the festivities.
</p>

<p>
You could try to bring the main attraction in your company -- slaves, of course.
The slave does not have to be properly trained -- any hole obedient or not can serve a fuckbooth after all --
but perhaps it is best to bring along a slaver or three to properly showcase the sex toy.
With the right approach and slogan, this could turn you a tidy amount of profit from the
sexually liberated farmers.
</p>

<p>
Your slavers built a makeshift pillory in the middle of the village square,
and secured the
<<if $g.slave.isHasTrait('training_obedience_basic')>>
  obedient
<<else>>
  defiant
<</if>>
slave inside the pillory.
Following the old age advice of "test it before you deploy",
the slavers spent the better part of the first a day testing out and sampling the various
holes offered by the slave.
<<set _careless = setup.selectUnit([$g.trader, $g.trainer, $g.guard], {trait: 'per_brave'})>>
<<set _cautious = setup.selectUnit([$g.trader, $g.trainer, $g.guard], {trait: 'per_cautious'})>>
<<if _cautious>>
A prudently taken precaution, no doubt thanks to your careful slaver <<rep _cautious>>.
<<elseif _careless>>
(A complete turnaround from <<reps _careless>> usually careless self that you have no doubt won't stick long in the <<urace _careless>>.)
<</if>>
From the testing they made a couple of adjustments,
including the necessity of proper lubing and a place to gather up the bodily fluids leaking
from the slave to be sold for some extra income.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to the solid preparation by your slavers, the fuckbooth became
<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
  the biggest attraction
<<else>>
  a successful attraction
<</if>>
in the festival, drawing many people into trying
<<yourrep $g.slave>> out.
The slave's holes
<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
were almost always occupied
<<else>>
were used quite a lot
<</if>>
throughout the festival, with the villagers
becoming more and more creative as the festival go.
<<Rep $g.slave>> became familiar with the feeling of having all types of garden vegetables
shoved up <<their $g.slave>> <<uhole $g.slave>>, while your slavers happily count the money they managed
to make out of this festival.
<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
One of the well off attendee was so impressed with <<rep $g.slave>> after the slave took
his boot up the ass that he
offered your company a choice between buying one of your slaves or setting up contact with you,
which you should receive in your mail by now.
<</if>>
</p>


:: QuestFuckholeFairFailure [nobr]

<p>
Your slavers were lazy in their preparation, and did not rehearse the fuckbooth a day
before the festival.
As a result, they were missing a few key components during the festival,
including the necessity of heavy dosage of lube inside <<reps $g.slave>> <<ubody $g.slave>>.
<<if $gOutcome == 'disaster'>>
With proper lubing, 
the slave's holes were completely unusable after an hour in the hot day,
and your slavers had no choice but to close shop early.
<<else>>
Sex with the slave became too rough as a result, and
they did not attract many customers.
