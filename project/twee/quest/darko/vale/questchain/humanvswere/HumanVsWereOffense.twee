<<include 'OpportunityHumanVsWere'>>

<p>
You have chosen to launch a simultaneous attack with the werewolves, and kidnap yourself
some fresh villagers.
</p>


:: QuestHumanVsWereOffenseCrit [nobr]

<p>
Your slavers waited in tow in a nearby shrubbery, until they finally heard the
ringing sound of the village's alarm bells.
Chaos ensued as the werewolves flung themselves into the village, ransacking whatever
valuable stored in it.
<<set _calm = setup.selectUnit([$g.raider1, $g.raider2, $g.raidersupport], {trait: 'per_calm'})>>

Despite the chaos, <<rep _calm>> remained calm, before seeing an opportunity to

:: QuestHumanVsWereOffenseFailure [nobr]

<p>
Unfortunately, the villagers managed to repel the werewolves' attack.
As a result, your slavers did not find the opportunity to abduct any of the defenders.
But at least they never found out about your degenerate of a plan.
</p>


:: QuestHumanVsWereOffenseDisaster [nobr]

<p>
Unfortunately, your slavers got caught in the fighting and ended up injuring themselves.
Sustaining injuries, there was just no way for your slavers to be able to abduct
a villager or two.
