<p>
<<Rep $g.wanderer>> wanderer|have once again disappeared without a trace from
your fort. By now, you're already accustomed to the pattern, and you know
that the <<uadjgood $g.wanderer>> slaver will surely be back by next week.
But perhaps this is a chance for you to get to the bottom of this once and
for all.
</p>

<p>
You can send a group of slavers to try and track <<theslaver $g.wanderer>> down. A scout
familiar with the terrain, as well as a spotter should do the trick. Once
your slavers located the slaver, they still need to tail <<them
$g.wanderer>>, and a spy would do wonder for the success chance of this
mission.
</p>



:: Quest_the_wanderer_wandersCrit [nobr]

<p>
With some difficulty, <<rep $g.scout>> and <<utheirrel $g.scout $g.spotter>>
<<rep $g.spotter>> were able to pick up <<reps $g.wanderer>> worn-down trail.
They tracked <<theslaver $g.wanderer>> to a small thicket in the vale, far away from
civilization. It took them several days of tracking, but during one dawn they
finally found <<rep $g.wanderer>> alone under a pristine waterfall. But
something was wrong with the <<man $g.wanderer>>.
</p>

<p>
The <<man $g.wanderer>>'s back was... furry, to say the least. Your slavers
even spotted a pair of pointed ears sticking out from the slaver's head, as well as what
resembled a wolf tail. But there was no mistaking from the face and the trail
that this <<man $g.wanderer>> could only be <<yourrep $g.wanderer>>.
</p>

<p>
Before your slaver figured out what happened, the sun rose and a most
unbelievable occurrence happened before your slavers. <<Rep $g.wanderer>>
visibly transformed before your slavers' eyes, reverting all their furry bits
and went back into full human form.
</p>

<p>
Armed with this information, they came back to your fort and delivered their
full report to you.
You waited until <<yourrep $g.wanderer>> eventually came back to your
fort, and confronted <<theslaver $g.wanderer>> about this.
</p>

<p>
<<Reps $g.wanderer>> usually <<uadjgood $g.wanderer>> face immediately turned
sour, and then to what seemed to be despair. With no other way to wiggle
<<their $g.wanderer>> way out of this, <<they $g.wanderer>> revealed that
<<they $g.wanderer>> wanderer|is the <<daughter $g.wanderer>> of a werewolf
father and a northerner mother. This gives <<them $g.wanderer>> a unique
curse, in that <<they $g.wanderer>> can and must transform between <<their
$g.wanderer>> human form and <<their $g.wanderer>> werewolf form every now
and then. Given the animosity between the werewolves and the northerner, it
is no surprise that neither camp was willing to accept <<them $g.wanderer>> as
<<they $g.wanderer>> is. This was the real reason why <<they $g.wanderer>>
approached your company.
</p>

<p>
You should decide what to do with <<them $g.wanderer>>.
</p>

<p>
It seemed <<rep $g.wanderer>> covered up <<their $g.wanderer>> trail pretty
well. Your slavers had no clue where <<rep $g.wanderer>> went, and spent most
of the week aimlessly wandering across the vale.
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'disaster'>>
<p>
They were accosted by bandits along the way, and was injured during the ensuing fight.
