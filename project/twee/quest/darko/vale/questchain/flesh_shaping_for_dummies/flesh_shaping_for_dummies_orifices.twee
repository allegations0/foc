Having obtained the legendary "Flesh-Shaping for Dummies" book, <<yourrep _u>> immediately begins to work advancing their mastery over their water magic. According to the book, "practice makes perfect", and to master the magic, <<rep _u>> must practice flesh-shaping on various targets. The first step is easy, "shaping orifices" by gaping them wide. Surely this is a feat worthy of an advanced flesh-shaping magic, and surely it's not just by gaping them by force...
</p>

<p>
Either way, a pair of "volunteers" are needed. To make the learning experience as effective as possible, both must still possess virgin-tight orifices. By the end of the procedure, there is little doubt what would happen to their orifices, but you get the feeling that <<yourrep _u>> lack of mastery will also lead to other holes being gaped, not necessarily just those belonging to the volunteers...

<p>
A grueling six weeks later, after many screams were heard from the ritual room, <<yourrep $g.slaver>> slaver|have finally finished <<their $g.slaver>> studies on the subject of gaping holes with water magic.
You can't be sure if it was really via flesh-shaping magic, or whether it was simply by forcing a silly amount of water in, but whatever it was, it certainly did the job. The two slaves are now a mess, their once virgin-tight holes have been permanently gaped into cavernous gapes.
<<if !$g.slaver.isHasTrait('anus_gape')>>
That's not all, however. It turned out that <<therace $g.slaver>> had accidentally lost control of <<their $g.slaver>> magic during the ritual, and as a result <<their $g.slaver>> own anus was also affected...
<<elseif !$g.slaver.isHasTrait('vagina_gape')>>
That's not all, however. It turned out that <<therace $g.slaver>> had accidentally lost control of <<their $g.slaver>> magic during the ritual, and as a result <<their $g.slaver>> own pussy was also affected...
<</if>>
</p>

<p>
Still, it was not all for nothing.
<<Yourrep $g.slaver>> slaver|is now ready, at least according to the book, to advanced into the next step of becoming a master of water magic.
No doubt you will need to supply more slaves for the venture, however...
You just hope that the rewards are going to be worth all these efforts.
