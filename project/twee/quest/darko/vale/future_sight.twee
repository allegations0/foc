:: Quest_future_sight [nobr]
<p>
A famous seer lives in one of the many settlements on the <<lore region_vale>>.
<<They $g.seer>> seer|is not only known for great <<their $g.seer>> <<beauty $g.seer>>, but also for <<their $g.seer>> uncanny ability to predict the future.
</p>

<p>
You can send a group of slavers with some money to try and use <<their $g.seer>> services â€”- using <<their $g.seer>> future sight, it would be trivial to profit from the information. <<They $g.seer>> may also grant you insight into upcoming quests, even from faraway regions.
</p>


:: Quest_future_sightCrit [nobr]

<p>
The seer gracefully accepted the money your slavers brought and provided them with
multiple future insights on the upcoming droughts as well as opportunities in nearby lands.
Your slavers contemplated having such a divine <<beauty $g.seer>> as a slave, but
<<yourrep $g.seer1>> and <<utheirrel $g.seer1 $g.seer2>> <<rep $g.seer2>> could both sense the vast magical power from
the seer, so much that it would be extremely foolish to even attempt to do so. They just
had to be satisfied at looking at <<their $g.seer>> divine <<beauty $g.seer>> through the
scrying ball.
</p>


:: Quest_future_sightSuccess [nobr]

<p>
The seer accepted the money your slavers brought and while <<they $g.seer>> gave a
great length of insightful divinations to your slavers,
your slavers were too busy watching <<their $g.seer>>
divine <<beauty $g.seer>> to pay attention.
<<if $g.seer.isMale()>>
The chiseled face, hint of stubble, and the rugged exterior
<<else>>
The wavy hair, hint of blush, and the clear eyes
<</if>>
were simply too much,
and there was no way your slavers could concentrate on the task.
At the end, your slavers were only able
to remember very few things from the session, still valuable, but nowhere near
as productive as it could have been.
</p>


:: Quest_future_sightFailure [nobr]

<p>
Unfortunately by the time your slavers had arrived at the seer's encampment,
<<they $g.seer>> seemed to have already moved on to a new place.
Your slavers were unable to track where the seer has moved to.
</p>


:: Quest_future_sightDisaster [nobr]

<p>
After accepting the money, the seer divined nothing but bad omens for your slavers.
A few days later, <<rep $g.convincer>> convincer|was struck by a stray wild boar who appeared out of nowhere as your slavers were returning to the fort.
</p>
