:: QuestValeFarmRaid [nobr]

<p>
Welcome to the world of raiding! All raiders must begin somewhere, and what better
place to start than to raid an innocent little farm on the <<lore region_vale>>!
Lightly guarded, promising good amount of reward, and also promising you the
earthly bounty in the form of the farmer's own <<daughter $g.farmer>>, it surely is the perfect target
for an enterprising company such as yourself.
</p>


:: QuestValeFarmRaidCrit [nobr]

<p>
Your slavers launched a very textboox raid on the farm.

<<set _intim = setup.selectUnit([$g.raider1, $g.raider2, $g.support], {trait: 'skill_intimidating'})>>
<<set _scary = setup.selectUnit([$g.raider1, $g.raider2, $g.support], {trait: 'face_scary'})>>
<<set _muscle = setup.selectUnit([$g.raider1, $g.raider2, $g.support], {trait: 'muscle_verystrong'})>>
<<set _cruel = setup.selectUnit([$g.raider1, $g.raider2, $g.support], {trait: 'per_cruel'})>>
<<set _agg = setup.selectUnit([$g.raider1, $g.raider2, $g.support], {trait: 'per_aggressive'})>>

<<if _intim>>
  <<Rep _intim>> used <<their _intim>> intimidation skills to scare off the farmerhands, leaving the farm
  empty for the moment.

<<elseif _muscle>>
  <<Rep _muscle>> used <<their _muscle>> bulging muscles to scare off the farmerhands, leaving the farm
  empty for the moment.

<<elseif _scary>>
  <<Rep _scary>> used <<their _scary>> scary face to scare off the farmerhands, leaving the farm
  empty for the moment.

<<elseif _cruel>>
  <<Rep _cruel>> cruelly assaulted one of the farmhands, leaving the rest fleeing for their lives and the farm empty.

<<elseif _agg>>
  <<Rep _agg>> aggressively assaulted one of the farmhands, leaving the rest fleeing for their lives and the farm empty.

<<else>>
  They set fire into the fields, which alarmed the farmers.
<</if>>

With the farmers gone, there was nobody guarding their homes.
Your slavers proceeded to ransack the buildings, stealing many valuables.
<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
<<rep $g.raider1>> raider1|was even able to <<uadv $g.raider1>> nab the farmer's
<<daughter $g.farmer>> to bring back to the fort as a potential trophy after a little
friendly gang-fuck.
<</if>>
</p>


:: QuestValeFarmRaidFailure [nobr]

<p>
Unfortunately, your company was not the only company that came up with the idea to raid
such a juicy target.
By the time your slavers arrived,
the farm had already been torched and ransacked.
Nothing of value were found.
</p>


:: QuestValeFarmRaidDisaster [nobr]

<p>
Your slavers made a grave error in picking a long-standing farm in the region.
It turned out that there was a very good reason why no raiders dared to touch this particular farm --
These farmers were fierce, and armed themselves the moment they see your slavers coming.
For a group of farmers they fought like heroes of legends, and your slavers were soundly defeated.
