:: TreatmentHealBasic [nobr]
<p>
Heal a unit, which removes about 4 weeks worth of injuries.
</p>

:: TreatmentHealBasicCrit [nobr]
<p>
<<Rep $g.head>> directed the healing procedure, effectively using the
<<rep setup.item.healing_potion>> to heal an extraordinarily large amount of injuries
from <<rep $g.trainee>>.
</p>

:: TreatmentHealBasicSuccess [nobr]
<p>
The healing procedure went about as well as expected,
with the
<<rep setup.item.healing_potion>> being used with standard efficiency to sufficiently heal
<<rep $g.trainee>>.
</p>

:: TreatmentHealBasicFailure [nobr]
<p>
<<Rep $g.head>> head|was wasteful in <<their $g.head>> use of the
<<rep setup.item.healing_potion>> and only able to heal <<rep $g.trainee>> by a small amount.
</p>

:: TreatmentHealBasicDisaster [nobr]
<p>
Your slavers mismanaged the healing operation resulting in the <<rep setup.item.healing_potion>> being
completely wasted without any noticable effect on <<rep $g.trainee>>.
</p>
