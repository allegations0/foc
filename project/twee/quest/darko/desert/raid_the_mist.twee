:: Quest_raid_the_mist [nobr]

<p>
Some corners of the <<lore region_desert>> is thick with <<lore concept_mist>>.
Normal people (whose common sense is still intact) would avoid these places at all costs.
You on the other hand think that with a sufficienly powerful dark magi, it might be possible to rip
apart the boundary between this world and the next from these thickly misted areas.
The land beyond is inhabited by many <<rep setup.trait.race_demon>> -- and although
pureblood demons would probably be too difficult for your slavers to capture, it might 
be possible to capture their underlings, the <<rep setup.trait.subrace_demonkin>>.
This still pose incredible risk to whoever are unlucky enough to be
sent on this mission however. The stuffs the demons would do to whoever become trapped there is beyond degrading.

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
  <<if $g.slave.isMale()>>
  <<else>>
    <<questimage "raid_the_mist_female.jpg">>
  <</if>>
<</if>>

<p>
Once your slavers arrived at the area, <<yourrep $g.warrior1>> and
<<utheirrel $g.warrior1 $g.warrior2>> <<rep $g.warrior2>> <<uadv $g.warrior1>>
put their trusts in <<rep $g.gatekeeper>>.
<<Rep $g.gatekeeper>> opened the gate to the land beyond <<lore
concept_mist>> and must keep it open until your slavers finished their
duties there.
<<if $g.gatekeeper.isHasTrait('per_dreamy')>>
<<Rep $g.gatekeeper>> may gatekeeper|have trouble focusing, but <<they $g.gatekeeper>>
will just have to do <<their $g.gatekeeper>> utmost to keep <<their $g.gatekeeper>> allies
safe.
<<elseif $g.gatekeeper.isHasTrait('per_attentive')>>
Fortunately, <<rep $g.gatekeeper>> gatekeeper|is a rather attentive <<urace $g.gatekeeper>>,
and should have no problem holding down the fort.
<</if>>
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'failure'>>

<p>
Your slavers were not ready at all for the sights they encountered inside.
Dumbstruck, your slavers failed to notice the corruption spell
that were cast on them by a nearby demon. After being hit by the spell,
your slavers regained their focus, and decided that
escape was the only correct option at that point, and managed to exit back to the gate
although sustaining heavy injuries in the process.
</p>

<<elseif $gOutcome == 'failure'>>

<p>
But the trust were misplaced.
Just right when the other two slavers entered the gate,
demons came out from the very same gate, assaulting <<yourrep $g.gatekeeper>>.
<<Their $g.gatekeeper>> gatekeeper|was broken, and the gate prematurely closed,
trapping both <<rep $g.warrior1>>
and <<rep $g.warrior2>> inside <<lore concept_mist>> with no way out.
</p>


<<else>>

<p>
Once inside, <<yourrep $g.warrior1>> and <<rep $g.warrior2>> managed to maintain their
focuses, despite the numerous distractions presented to them within,
be it the voluptuous nightmarish boob that appeared out of nowhere,
or the literal dick fountain.
<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
Ultimately, they found a suitable looking demonkin in the middle of using a
slave that they managed to subdue and carry back into the gate and onto the mortal plane.
<<else>>
Ultimately, they found a suitable looking demonkin that they somehow managed to subdue,
although not without a cost.
<<Yourrep $g.warrior1>> warrior1|was caught in a corruption spell when
carrying back their prize back into the gate and towards the mortal plane.
<</if>>
</p>


<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
<p>
Once back at the desert with the new potential demonkin slave, your slavers
were completely caught by surprise as they were greeted by a second,
unfamiliar demonkin.
The masterless demonkin took interest in your slavers, and apparently
followed <<rep $g.warrior1>> and <<rep $g.warrior2>> out of the gate and into
the mortal realm.
As your slavers prepared to fight, <<rep $g.slaver>> instead assured your slavers that <<they $g.slaver>>
meant no harm, and only wished to join your company out of pure curiosity.
