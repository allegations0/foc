<p>
The <<lore region_desert>> are littered with various ruins from times past. These
ruins often went unexcavated, protected by the shifting sands. There are many
who made their living from finding hidden treasures in such ruins, but there
are equally many who ended their journey crushed by some trap within such ruins.
</p>

<p>
You have a lead on a possible such ruins that has just resurfaced after a sandstorm.
If you want to follow up on this
lead, you'd have to act fast before the shifting sands rebury the ruins back to
where it was hidden.
</p>

<p>
The ruins turned out to be the ruins of a temple. The temple
were flanked by engravings on all sides, depicting various
raunchy sexual act. One side depicted the various methods one could pursue
in order to maximize the chance of getting a male heir, including impregnating
multiple women all with a single climax.
The other side depicted various methods
of sexual torture to break even the most resilient of prisoners. There were
depictions of men and women chained to the same dildo which pushed both at
the same time, harder when they struggled,
while another depicted multiple weights being attached to the prisoners' genitals and
nipples while they were being whipped mercilessly.
</p>

<p>
The ancient drawings were kinda sexy,
<<set _lust = setup.selectUnit([$g.explorer1, $g.explorer2, $g.scout], {trait: 'per_lustful'})>>
<<set _chaste = setup.selectUnit([$g.explorer1, $g.explorer2, $g.scout], {trait: 'per_chaste'})>>

<<if _lust>>
  <<Rep _lust>> even lustfully masturbated to one, earning <<therace _lust>> strange looks from <<their _lust>>
  teammates.
<<elseif _chaste>>
  <<Rep _chaste>> tried <<their _chaste>> best not to look too much into the engravings as the chaste
  slaver could feel
  <<if _chaste.isHasDick()>>
    <<their _chaste>> dick rising.
  <<else>>
    the heat rising from inside.
  <</if>>
<</if>>
Still, sexiness alone could not pay your slavers' wages, and they <<uadv $g.explorer1>>
proceeded to carve out these engravings and gathered up the usable gold.
At the top of
the altar, they also found an ancient sex toy made of pure gold, which they decided
to keep for the company.

:: Quest_ruin_raider2Success [nobr]

<p>
Your slavers arrived at what appears to be an ancient trading hall. It seemed
that these halls once were a center of trade, dealing in both various goods and also in slaves.
There were many ancient pots that remained intact, which your slaver took with them.
There were also numerous shackles all over the walls and the ceilings.
Your slavers could only imagine what this place must have looked like back
then, when every shackle was filled by a slave for sale.
</p>


:: Quest_ruin_raider2Failure [nobr]
<p>
Your slavers arrived at what appeared to be a tomb. But due to excitement,
they did not tread carefully. Both <<yourrep
$g.explorer1>> and <<rep $g.explorer2>> were smacked in the face by a swinging trap.
Your slavers had no choice but to head back and tend to their injuries,
instead of risking their lives by going in further.
</p>


:: Quest_ruin_raider2Disaster [nobr]
<p>
Your slavers arrived at what appeared to be the ruins of a royal palace. Thinking that it
was such an easy place to loot, they rushed in only to discover that the place was
heavily trapped.
<<Rep $g.explorer1>> fell into one of the pit traps, and it is
unknown what fate awaits <<them $g.explorer1>> down there.
Your other slavers were unable to rescue <<therace $g.explorer1>>, and they had to come back
without their teammate.
