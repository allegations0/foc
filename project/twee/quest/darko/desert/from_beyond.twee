:: Quest_from_beyond [nobr]

<p>
The <<lore region_desert>> is infamous for hosting many areas that are thick
with <<lore concept_mist>>.
These areas occasionally allow passage between this world and the next.
While normally this would be of no interest to you, there are
rumors that the lusty moans of <<rep $g.slaver>>, one of your former slavers, could occasionally
be heard from the area.
</p>

<p>
In fact,
you have heard that one of these areas has gone so unstable that
a gateway can be seen materializing, opening up a way into the land beyond <<lore concept_mist>>.
It might just be possible for a group of purifiers to attempt to cross <<lore concept_mist>>
in a daring rescue mission for <<rep $g.slaver>>. Of course, any trinkets
they get along the way would also be extremely valuable back in this world.
However, such trip is no doubt very dangerous, and you must be prepared for your
slavers to come back corrupted or worse.
</p>


:: Quest_from_beyondCrit [nobr]
<p>
Led by <<rep $g.purifier>>, your slavers
<<uadv $g.purifier>>
braced through the narrow gap in <<lore concept_mist>> into the debauched
land beyond.

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
Ignoring all the demons and slaves writhing around them, your slavers
moved with the singular purpose of locating <<rep $g.slaver>>. Scouring room
through room without looking too much at all the broken slaves caged inside tiny
compartments, they finally found <<rep $g.slaver>> being mercilessly fucked
by a large demon. With a surprise attack, <<yourrep $g.warrior1>> and <<rep $g.warrior2>> subdued
the demon while <<rep $g.purifier>> saved <<rep $g.slaver>> before together,
they exited <<lore concept_mist>>. All in all, it was a successful mission, and
despite having just experienced such a harrowing experince, your slavers somehow managed to
keep <<rep $g.slaver>> relatively unchanged from the last time you saw <<them
$g.slaver>>.

<<elseif $gOutcome == 'success'>>

They were greeted by a vision of such debauchery that they stood in their
tracks for a while, before resuming their mission to locate and save <<rep
$g.slaver>>.
Going from room through room, they tried their best to ignore the many
visions within
They finally found <<rep $g.slaver>> being milked dry above a nasty looking
ritual chamber. Your slavers attempted to undo <<reps $g.slaver>> binding,
but then a slew of demonkins appeared who proceeded to cast various dark spells. <<Rep $g.purifier>>
tried <<their $g.purifier>> best to shield against the spells until finally
<<rep $g.slaver>> slaver|was freed. Together, your slavers ran back to the
entrance and escaped through the same gap they used earlier.
<<else>>
Immediately they were greeted with a vision so debauched that your slavers
were mesmerized in their tracks,
forgotting their original mission.
By the time they regained their senses, <<rep $g.purifier>> purifier|was already
tied up in one of the cages while <<rep $g.warrior1>> and <<rep $g.warrior2>>
were being anally used by two demonkin guards. With the senses regained, your slavers attempted to
break free and escape the place before much worse befall them. They sustained some
injuries and even got slightly corrupted, but they were able to escape the
place safely back into the deserts.
<<if $gOutcome == 'disaster'>>
Or so they thought until they realize that one of them went missing.
<</if>>
<</if>>
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'success'>>

<p>
The experience of being a demon plaything had physically changed <<rep
$g.slaver>> â€” even some of your slavers were also affected during their time
there. They can be purified later, should the opportunity arises.
</p>

<<elseif $gOutcome == 'failure' || $gOutcome == 'disaster'>>

<p>
During their time beyond <<lore concept_mist>>, they found no signs of <<rep $g.slaver>>.
Perhaps you can encounter the former slaver again some other time.
</p>

<</if>>
