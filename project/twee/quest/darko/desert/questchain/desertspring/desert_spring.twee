:: Quest_desert_spring [nobr]
<p>
    The <<lore region_desert>> is a mostly barren land, and water is a scarce resource. All too often, unprepared travelers would find themselves run out of water mid-journey, and would go to extreme lengths to secure themselves water. Some got lucky and found a hidden oasis here and there, but the fates of many others would remain unknown as they disappear in the vast unforgiving deserts.
</p>

<<set _u = setup.getAnySlaver()>>

<p>
    <<Yourrep _u>> has heard rumors about the sighting of a strange spring that would present itself to the most desperate of travelers. It would appear in the form of a single statue, with a single hole on its face. Intoxicatingly sweet smelling water wound drip freely from the hole and into the ground, a blessing for those travelers in need. It is unclear how and why such a mysterious oasis would appear, but the water must be magical, and it might be a good idea to send an alchemically experienced slaver to try and gather those mysterious liquid. They would need to hire someone as a bait, however, in order to try and make the spring appear. This incursion would incur a little money from your pockets.
</p>




:: Quest_desert_springCrit [nobr]
<p>
    <<Yourrep $g.alchemist>> <<uadv $g.alchemist>> hired one of the many desperate people in the desert. <<They $g.guide>>, a <<urace $g.guide>>, agreed quickly enough once your slavers dangled a bag of coins in front of <<them $g.guide>>, and didn't ask too many questions. A good thing too, for your slavers had evil plans for the poor <<urace $g.guide>> â€” they are going to lead <<them $g.guide>> into the desert and going to "accidentally spill out" <<their $g.guide>> portion of the water.
    <<set _unit = setup.selectUnit([$g.alchemist, $g.fighter1, $g.fighter2], {trait: 'per_kind'})>>
    <<if _unit>>
        <<Reps _unit>> bleeding heart ached at the thoughts,

        <<if _unit.isHasTrait('per_frugal')>>
            but <<their _unit>> greed won in the end.
        <<else>>
            <<run setup.qc.TraumatizeRandom('unit', 5).apply(setup.costUnitHelper(_unit))>>
            and <<they _unit>> ended up being a little distressed by the heinous act.
        <</if>>

    <</if>>
</p>

<p>
    After a while, the poor <<urace $g.guide>> became thirsty, and soon became desperate for water.
    Your slavers tried their best impression of desperation
    <<set _unit = setup.selectUnit([$g.alchemist, $g.fighter1, $g.fighter2], {anytrait: ['skill_creative', 'per_playful']})>>
    <<if _unit>>
        <<rep _unit>> being particularly creative at the act.
    <<else>>
        .
    <</if>>
    They continued to walk and walk, with your slavers secretly hoping for the mysterious spring to appear...
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'failure'>>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, the spring never made an appearance. After a long hot trek under the desert sun, your slavers could not endure it any longer, and gave up the search. They came home, empty-handed.
    </p>
<<else>>
    <p>
        After a few more hours, <<rep $g.alchemist>> spotted something in the vast empty desert.
        A protruding featureless statue, save for an intoxicatingly sweet smell coming out of it, and the sound of water falling into the ground.
    </p>

    <<if $gOutcome == 'disaster'>>
        <p>
            By this point, your slavers had made a grave miscalculation, and had also run out of their supply of water. With all of the party desperate, your slavers run after the watering hole and gulped down the oh-so-sweet heavenly water that might have just saved their lives.
            They spent so many minutes, then hours, then day at the spring, doing nothing but drinking the water, their mind getting blanker and blanker...
        </p>

        <<if $gQuest.getSeed() % 2 == 0>>
            <<set $g.gone = $g.fighter1>>
            <<set $g.stay = $g.fighter2>>
        <<elseif $gQuest.getSeed() % 2 == 1>>
            <<set $g.gone = $g.fighter2>>
            <<set $g.stay = $g.fighter1>>
        <</if>>

        <p>
            When your slavers returned to consciousness, they were all naked in the middle of the desert,
            with no recollection of what had transpired.
            That is, save for <<reps $g.stay>> now gaping hole and the disappearance of both <<rep $g.gone>> as well as the little help they had hired before. Who knows what might had happened to these poor people? <<uneedrescue $g.gone>>, and hopefully nothing too bad had befallen them...
        </p>

    <<else>>

        <p>
            The desperate <<urace $g.guide>> helper your slavers had hired rushed for the water source, and greedily slurped down the water from the hole.
            Within moments, <<their $g.guide>> desperate eyes changed, losing all signs of intelligence, becoming perfectly blank and malleable.
            Tentacles then spawn from underneath the gazed <<urace $g.guide>>, hoisting <<them $g.guide>> up by <<their $g.guide>> <<uhole $g.guide>> by painfully inserting the appendage up the tight orifice. <<Their $g.guide>> <<umouth $g.guide>> is next, as another appendage inserted itself throat deep into <<their $g.guide>> <<umouth $g.guide>>. More appendage then sprung up, enveloping the poor <<man $g.guide>>, before dragging <<them $g.guide>> underground...
        </p>

        <p>
            Silence then returned, and the spring stayed, water back flowing freely from the hole.
            <<Yourrep $g.alchemist>> managed to stay focused.
            <<if $g.alchemist.isHasTrait('per_lustful')>>
                (Although the lusty <<urace $g.alchemist>> was a little aroused from the show!)
            <</if>>
            <<They $g.alchemist>> whipped out the beakers <<they $g.alchemist>> had been preparing, and carefully tapped some of the water into the container, making sure no tentacles would capture <<them $g.alchemist>> unaware.
        </p>

        <<if $gOutcome == 'success'>>
            <p>
                With the flask full, <<rep $g.alchemist>> put the now valuable potion back into <<their $g.alchemist>> backpack, and headed home. It's too bad they couldn't bring the guide back as a slave.
                <<set _unit = setup.selectUnit([$g.alchemist, $g.fighter1, $g.fighter2], {trait: 'per_chaste'})>>
                <<if _unit>>
                    The chaste slaver <<rep _unit>> tried <<their _unit>> best not to think too hard what fate await the unfortunate <<urace $g.guide>>...
                <</if>>
            </p>
        <<else>>
            <<if $g.guide.isMale()>>
                <<questimage "desert_spring_male.jpg">>
            <<else>>
                <<questimage "desert_spring_female.jpg">>
            <</if>>

            <p>
                <<Rep $g.alchemist>> suggested to risk nothing and went back, but <<yourrep $g.fighter1>> convinced the team that there might be another opportunity hidden right here.
                Besides, your slavers were a little too curious perhaps to know what might have happened to the poor <<urace $g.guide>>.
                Drawing from
                <<if $g.alchemist.isHasTrait('skill_animal')>>
                    <<their $g.alchemist>> connection to animals.
                <<elseif $g.alchemist.isHasTrait('bg_scholar')>>
                    <<their $g.alchemist>> past as a scholar,
                <<elseif $g.alchemist.isHasTrait('bg_wiseman')>>
                    <<their $g.alchemist>> past as a wiseman,
                <<elseif $g.alchemist.isHasTrait('per_studious')>>
                    a book <<they $g.alchemist>> once read as a hobby,
                <<elseif $g.alchemist.isHasTrait('per_gregarious')>>
                    a particular conversation <<they $g.alchemist>> casually had in a party,
                <<elseif $g.alchemist.isHasTrait('per_curious')>>
                    an esoteric knowledge the curious <<urace $g.alchemist>> happened to know,
                <<elseif $g.alchemist.isHasTrait('per_attentive')>>
                    <<their $g.alchemist>> keen observation,
                <<else>>
                    an esoteric knowledge <<they $g.alchemist>> know by sheer luck,
                <</if>>
                <<yourrep $g.alchemist>>
                recognized the signs all too well to point to a certain culprit.
                A certain mindless tentacle abomination is said to exist in the deserts, luring unfortunate travelers
                and enslaving them inside its body, to be used as an egg incubator.
                If this is true, then this "watering hole" is nothing more than the top of its body, and underneath it is a vast body of a monstrous but mindless creature endlessly laying egg inside one of its surely many victims...
            </p>

            <p>
                Your slavers got to work to verify the information. Digging a little deeper, they indeed found the pink fleshy body of a monster. It seems that <<rep $g.alchemist>> was correct! <<Rep $g.fighter1>> <<uadv $g.fighter1>> plunged <<their $g.fighter1>> <<uweapon $g.fighter1>> into the monster's body,
                <<if !$settings.bannedtags.gore>>
                    its blood spraying everywhere,
                <</if>>
                killing the beast once and for all.
            </p>

            <p>
                Its victims were spitted above ground, all covered in rubbery slime and their stomach bulging with what your slavers suppose to be monster eggs.
                Their eyes were already completely devoid of intelligence, their mind completely broken from the extreme treatment of being used as a monster breeding chamber â€” that is, save for the poor <<urace $g.guide>> who had just been freshly converted. Still, the monster had done quite a number of <<their $g.guide>> once virginally tight holes â€” it's now a lewd gape, and their asshole looks like a pussy now.
            </p>

            <p>
                Your slavers spent the rest of the weeks pumping as much eggs as possible from their stomach, before bringing the poor and mindbroken victims back home, as well as the <<rep $g.guide>>, to be remade as your slavers.
                Clearly being your slave is a much better predicament that whatever they had experienced inside the monster's body?
