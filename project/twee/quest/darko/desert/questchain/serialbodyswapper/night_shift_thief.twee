:: Quest_night_shiftCrit [nobr]

<p>
Simple problem requires simple solution: <<Yourrep $g.defender>> will <<uadv
$g.defender>> keep watch over the <<daughter $g.slave>> while <<rep
$g.trapper>> and <<rep $g.shadow>> secured the house, blocking all possible
entrances and reinforcing the all the weakest points of the house.
Once the preparations were complete, they waited for the attack...
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>

<p>
A few days later, during one of their night shifts, your slavers heard a loud crashing
sound coming from the second floor. <<Yourrep $g.trapper>> rushed upstairs and saw a
dark shade apparently kneeling in pain from their own entry into the mansion.
<<Rep $g.defender>> easily subdued the inexperienced thief with a
painful-looking headlock. The crash woke up all the residents of the
mansions, including the head of the mansion. Seeing the thief securely
bound within the painful embrace of <<therace $g.defender>>,
the head of the mansion lavished praises upon your
slavers before sending them back to your fort with plenty of money in a hurry
— no doubt in order to punish the wannabe thief in unspeakable ways...
</p>

<p>
Your slavers wandered whether this was the same thief as the rumored one, or
it was just a plain coincidence that the thief decided to rob this very mansion.
Either way, the thief got what <<they $g.slave>> deserve, trying to rob a mansion on high-alert.
</p>

<<else>>

<p>
After a couple of days, your slavers were woken up in the middle of the night
by a loud thud. Led by <<yourrep $g.trapper>>, your slavers rushed upstairs and
saw one of the other mercenaries securing what seemed to be a wannabe-thief to
the ground. The thud woke up all the residents of the mansion — seeing the
thief captured by the mercenary, the head of the mansion lavished praises
upon the mercenary. Your slavers' services were deemed no longer necessary.
Your slavers were hurriedly sent back to your fort with plenty of money --
— no doubt so that <<they $g.slave>> can punish the wannabe thief in unspeakable ways...
</p>

<</if>>

<p>
Another unfortunate household received another calling card in the next few days.
</p>


:: Quest_night_shiftFailure [nobr]

<p>
Your slavers were somewhat clueless in this kind of mission where they have
to protect instead of steal. None of your slavers, especially not <<yourrep
$g.shadow>>, managed to noticed when a thief broke in in the dead of the
night and stole one of the paintings off the second floor.
<<if $gOutcome == 'failure'>>
The head of the mansion was understandably furious with the mercenaries they hired, and
ordered all of them to reimburse the losses.
Your slavers were not given much choice in the matter and had to contribute
some money for the damages.
<<else>>
Worse, the painting was in the very same room that your slavers were supposed to guard that night.
With no excuses to be had, the slavers were forced to pay an exorbitant amount for the damages.
<</if>>

</p>


<<if $gOutcome == 'disaster'>>
<p>
You have a sneaking suspicion that your slavers <<uadv $g.shadow>> slept
through the night they were supposed to watch over. You remind yourself to
deliver a strongly-put speech with them later.
</p>
