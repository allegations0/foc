<<include 'Opportunity_desert_purifiers'>>

<p>
You have chosen to forcefully recruit a purifier.
</p>


:: Quest_desert_purifiers_recruitCrit [nobr]
<p>
The purifier had settled camp near an oasis and provided services to surrounding settlements.
Your slavers arrived at the compound pretending to be patrons, and negotiated
with the purifier for a personal session.
Once alone, <<rep $g.corruptor>> <<uadv $g.corruptor>>
worked <<their $g.corruptor>> magic, corruption
the once pure <<maiden $g.purifier>>'s mind into a twisted diabolical one,
a far cry from what <<they $g.purifier>> purifier|was once.

<<if $g.corruptor.isHasTrait('per_evil')>>
  An evil smile grew at <<reps $g.corruptor>> face as <<they $g.corruptor>> took in <<their $g.corruptor>> work.
<</if>>

At the end of the private session, <<rep $g.purifier>> wholeheartedly agreed to join your company
as a slaver, abandoning <<their $g.purifier>> previous life and companions.
You have certainly recruited a powerful slaver, but at what cost?
</p>

:: Quest_desert_purifiers_recruitSuccess [nobr]

<p>
The purifier has settled camp near an oasis and provided services to surrounding settlements.
Your slavers arrived at the compound pretending to be patrons, and waited until the lead
purifier happened to be alone
But they were unable to manipulate the encampment and was unable to find the right opportunity.
In the end, your slavers settled with corrupting <<their $g.purifier>> student instead.
The once innocent apprentice was <<uadv $g.corruptor>> twisted by <<reps $g.corruptor>> magic into
an evil and devilish person who then wholeheartedly agreed to join your company as a slaver.
A slaver proficient in fire magic such as <<rep $g.student>> will surely prove useful in your company.
