:: Quest_desert_purifiers_enslave [nobr]

<<include 'Opportunity_desert_purifiers'>>

<p>
You have foolishly chosen to try and enslave a purifier.
</p>


:: Quest_desert_purifiers_enslaveCrit [nobr]

<p>
The purifier had settled camp near an oasis and provided <<their $g.purifier>> services to the
surrounding settlements.
Your slavers waited until nightfall before <<rep $g.corruptor>> <<uadv $g.corruptor>>
began <<their $g.corruptor>> dark work.
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
<p>
Within moments,
dark energies corrupted tendrils shot out of the grounds throughout the encampment.
The purifier were not defenseless however and <<their $g.purifier>> many
followers soon attempted to fight through the corruptions. But <<rep
$g.warrior1>> and <<rep $g.warrior2>> managed to turn the tide of battle in
your favor and soon enough <<rep $g.corruptor>> had all the time
in the world to enter and capture <<rep $g.purifier>>.
</p>

<p>
Long after your slavers had left the compound,
moaning sounds could still be heard throughout the
encampment as the purifier's followers were ravaged thoroughly by the many
corrupted tendrils that kept spawning and feeding throughout the encampment.
</p>

<<else>>

<p>
Soon after, dark corrupted warriors spawn out of nowhere and invaded the
encampment. Your slavers did nothing but watch as the once pure camp followers one by one were
subdued by the demonic soldiers and fucked mercilessly.
</p>

<p>
The lead demon, having seen the <<if $g.purifier.isFemale()>> strikingly beautiful <<else>>
strikingly handsome <</if>> purifier, decided to take the purifier as payment for
their services. <<Yourrep $g.corruptor>> corruptor|was unable to do anything as
the object of your quest purifier|was taken as a living cock-sheathe by the demon and
disappeared together through <<lore concept_mist>>.
</p>

<p>
Having no option but to leave without the purifier, your slavers picked a still usable camp
followers out of the ex-purifiers and took <<them $g.guard>> home as a consolation prize.
As your slavers exited the camp, the wailing and moaning of the victims could still be
heard even from a distance...
</p>

<</if>>


:: Quest_desert_purifiers_enslaveFailure [nobr]
<p>
The purifier had settled camp near an oasis and provided services to
surrounding settlements.
However, your slavers caught glimpse of the head purifier and somehow
<<their $g.purifier>> divine <<if $g.purifier.isFemale()>>beauty<<else>>handsomeness<</if>>
disarmed your slavers of all their evil intentions.
<<if $gOutcome == 'failure'>>
With their intentions gone, your
slavers decided to come in peace to the encampment. The purifier
blessed your slavers for such forthcomingness, and your slavers
later returned back home less corrupt than before.
<<else>>
Within moment
your slavers prostrated themselves in front of <<rep $g.purifier>>, leaving
tithes and promising more tithe in the future. <<Rep $g.purifier>> blessed
them for their generosity, and ultimately your slavers came back home less
corrupt than ever but with a mounting amount of debt.
<</if>>
