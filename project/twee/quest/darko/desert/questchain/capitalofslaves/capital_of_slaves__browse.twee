<p>
The slave market of Qarma was truly a sight to behold. Naked slaves were on
full display everywhere â€” from a muscularly built ex-raider who was being
continuously whipped to showcase his endurance, to a lady with breasts so
large she cannot move on her own.

<<set _cur = setup.selectUnit([$g.appraiser1, $g.appraiser2, $g.trader], {trait: 'per_curious'})>>
<<if _cur>>
The various strange merchandise on display was very interesting for the curious <<rep _cur>>.
<</if>>

<<Yourrep $g.appraiser1>> and <<rep $g.appraiser2>> <<uadv $g.appraiser1>>
worked their best
to appraise the slaves under the hot sun of Qarma,

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
and they were so successful that they returned with ten decently-priced candidates for
you to browse including one particularly rare slave.
<<elseif $gOutcome == 'success'>>
and returned with five decently-priced candidates for you to browse.
<<else>>
but your slavers were incompetent
were only able to find two decently priced slaves for you to browse.

<</if>>

Unfortunately, your slavers were mistaken for raiders and were denied entry to
the city. They had no choice but to went back home, having wasted two weeks of work.
