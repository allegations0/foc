<p>
You have chosen to send a team of slavers to 
sneak into the market at night and score yourself some slaves.
</p>


:: Quest_capital_of_slaves__steal_waresCrit [nobr]

<p>
The slave market of Qarma looked very different at night. Instead of naked
bodies being displayed under the scorching sun of Qarma,
there are instead plenty of crates covered in drapes, and you can hear soft
moans coming from within these crates.
But it was mostly quiet, as slave owners are required to gag their
slaves overnight to maintain peace and quiet in the city.
Some slave owners even use the night as an opportunity to further train their slaves â€”
be it to enlarge their orifices by overnight rape or by putting several slaves together
inside one crate to make them more horny.

<<set _lust = setup.selectUnit([$g.thief1, $g.thief2, $g.muscle], {trait: 'per_lustful'})>>
<<if _lust>>
  And judging from
  <<if _lust.isHasDick()>>
    <<set _pants = _lust.getGenitalCovering()>>
    <<if _pants>>
      the tent forming on <<reps _lust>> <<rep _pants>>,
    <<else>>
      <<reps _lust>> rising naked erection,
    <</if>>
  <<else>>
  the slight flush on <<reps _lust>> face,
  <</if>>
  the slaves were not the only one who got rather horny that night.
<</if>>

</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
<p>
After sneaking through the market, your slavers managed to find one
cage containing three interlocked slaves, where the slaves were locked in position
so that each one is forced to eat another's genitals.
<<Yourrep $g.thief1>> <<uadv $g.thief1>>
made quick work of the lock before <<rep $g.muscle>> carried the moaning trio of slaves
safely outside the city and ultimately back into your camp.
</p>

<<else>>
<p>
Your slavers were anxious and <<uadv $g.thief1>>
grabbed the nearest possible crate to steal. It happened to contain two slaves
making love with each other. The pair of slaves were kidnapped and smuggled outside from the city
without anyone noticing.
</p>
<</if>>

<p>
Unfortunately, your slavers were spotted by guards as they attempted to sneak
into the city under the cover of the night, and was shot with arrows.
Injured, your slavers decided the best way to proceed was to retreat home.
</p>


:: Quest_capital_of_slaves__steal_waresDisaster [nobr]
<p>
That night, <<rep $g.thief1>> and <<rep $g.thief2>> never made it out from the city.
You later received a brochure about a slave sale in the Capital of Slaves and
were not really surprised to see their names being listed next to the slaves they were
supposed to steal. It is still not too late for you to buy their freedoms
back, but it will cost quite a bit.
</p>
