<<set _u = setup.getUnit({job: setup.job.slaver, title: 'quest_consumed_by_fire_0'})>>

<<if !_u>>
  <<missingunitquest>>
<<else>>

<p>
  You have discovered a way to recover part of <<rep _u>>'s long lost mind, if you choose to.
  It will be incredibly difficult, and also requires a suitable amount of preparation.
  First of all, two accomplished wizards are required to perform the
  gruelingly long and challenging ritual.
  But that's not the difficult part...
</p>

<p>
  To restore <<rep _u>>'s personalities back, the spell requires two other units
  to take the personality from.
  Two slaves, whose personalities combined matches as much as possible with <<rep _u>>
  prior to being emptied.
  If you recall correctly, <<rep _u>> used to have the following traits:
  <<for _traitkey range $varstore.get('be_cleansed_in_fire_traits')>>
    <<if _traitkey in setup.trait>>
      <<rep setup.trait[_traitkey]>>
    <</if>>
  <</for>>.
  The ritual will restore all of these traits that are also present in one of the slaves.
  But of course, there is no question what will happen to the slaves once their spirits have been
  entirely emptied out...
</p>

<p>
  Meanwhile, <<yourrep _u>> looks perfectly content, despite looking somewhat
  blank-faced and having no
  enthusiasim in anything. Still, it would be also a perfectly normal
  strategy to just ignore this
  opportunity, and accept <<rep _u>> for what <<they _u>> is now.
</p>

<</if>>

<p>
<<Yourrep $g.wizard1>> and <<utheirrel $g.wizard1 $g.wizard2>> scoured the
vast deserts of the eastern land, and with <<yourrep $g.student>> in tow, they
finally found the temple of fire, hidden under the sands. Standing
magnificently there was the very same statue that blessed <<rep $g.student>>
with <<their $g.student>> magic. There could be no mistaking it, this must be
the ritual site that your slavers were looking for.
</p>

<p>
After setting and securing both <<yourrep $g.slave>> and <<rep $g.slave2>> on the altar,
<<rep $g.wizard1>> began chanting as <<rep $g.student>> stood in front of the
altar, remaining as blank and unnervingly neutral as ever.
The spell was incredibly difficult, requiring a chant to be chanted together
by your two slavers, but <<rep $g.wizard2>> and <<utheirrel $g.wizard2
$g.wizard1>> are not strangers to magic, and they <<uadv $g.wizard1>> performed
the rite.
</p>

<p>
Your slavers could see a reddish aura starting to form around the statue.
The aura then slowly transferred over into the struggling slaves, bound over
the altar, before encasing the slaves entirely within its embrace.
Then slowly, bits of histories and personality transferred over from the slaves onto
<<rep $g.student>>, and your slavers can see the living being absorbed out of
both <<rep $g.slave>> and <<rep $g.slave2>>,
and put into <<yourrep $g.student>>.
</p>

<<set _restore = $varstore.get('be_cleansed_in_fire_traits')>>
<<if _restore && _restore.length>>
<<set _recovered = 0>>
<<for _trait range _restore>>
  <<if _trait in setup.trait>>
    <<if $g.slave.isHasTraitExact(_trait) || $g.slave2.isHasTraitExact(_trait)>>
      <<run setup.qc.TraitReplace('student', _trait).apply($gQuest)>>
      <<run _recovered += 1>>
    <</if>>
  <</if>>
<</for>>
<</if>>

<p>
The ritual took hours to complete, but by the end the result was apparent.
Light had returned to <<reps $g.student>> eyes, and once again the color of
live had returned to <<their $g.student>> world.
All it took in exchange was two slaves who became completely mindbroken, and only
suitable to be used as fucktoys for a lucky owner.
<<if !_recovered>>
  While <<their $g.student>> personality is now lost permanently, at least
  <<they $g.student>> student|is slightly
  more eager to learn new things now.
  <<run setup.qc.TraitReplace('student', 'per_curious').apply($gQuest)>>
<</if>>
<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
  Also, <<rep $g.student>> seemed to also gain a personality <<they
  $g.student>> never had before, a fortunate side effect.
<</if>>
With their mind somewhat returned to <<them $g.student>>, <<rep $g.student>>
student|is now back to <<their $g.student>> eager self, and <<they $g.student>>
can't wait to get back home and start <<= setup.Text.Hobby.verb($g.student)>>
again.

<p>
Despite the few weeks scouring through the deserts, <<rep $g.wizard1>> and
the rest of the team were unable to find the Temple of Fire, hidden
under the sands. They eventually gave up, heading back to the fort while
half-dragging <<yourrep $g.student>> along, who remained as blank as ever.
</p>

<p>
<<Yourrep $g.wizard1>> and <<utheirrel $g.wizard1 $g.wizard2>> scoured the
vast deserts of the eastern land, and with <<yourrep $g.student>> in tow, they
finally found the temple of fire, hidden under the sands. Standing

$g.wizard1>> are not strangers to magic, and they <<uadv $g.wizard1>> performed
the rite.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, the ritual backfired and the magic went out of control,
swirling from the statue into all your slavers. Your slavers were scorched by
the pure fire, who detected all the evil deeds of your slavers and attempted
to purify all of them. The slaves suffered the worst blunt of the explosion,
incurring injuries that would take months to heal.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, all the injuries seem temporary, with no permanent damage being
inflicted upon your team. You'll just have to try again later, hopefully
with a more prepared team this time.
</p>
