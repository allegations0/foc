<<include 'Opportunity_mist_merge'>>

<p>
You have chosen to assist the ritual in hope of recruiting a demon.
</p>


:: Quest_mist_merge_complete23Crit [nobr]

<p>
With the assistance of your slavers, the dark wizard were able to complete the ritual.
The possessed slave who now goes by <<name $g.fullpossess>>, greeted the slavers sultry
and thanked them for summoning <<them $g.fullpossess>> into the mortal plane.
In front of your slavers' eyes,
they could see the changes to the once pure <<urace $g.fullpossess>> body â€”
in particular, the body "assets" are definitely larger and more demonic in nature.
</p>

<p>
After the wizard obtained the knowledge he seeked from the demon, <<name $g.fullpossess>>
became free to wander the mortal plane, and <<yourrep $g.corruptor1>> <<uadv $g.corruptor1>>
recruited the curious demon into your company.

<<set _demon = setup.selectUnit([$g.corruptor1, $g.corruptor2, $g.guard], {trait: 'subrace_demon'})>>
<<set _racedemon = setup.selectUnit([$g.corruptor1, $g.corruptor2, $g.guard], {trait: 'race_demon'})>>
<<set _mist = setup.selectUnit([$g.corruptor1, $g.corruptor2, $g.guard], {trait: 'bg_mist'})>>
<<set _sex = setup.selectUnit([$g.corruptor1, $g.corruptor2, $g.guard], {trait: 'per_sexaddict'})>>
<<set _dick = setup.selectUnit([$g.corruptor1, $g.corruptor2, $g.guard], {trait: 'dick_huge'})>>
<<set _breast = setup.selectUnit([$g.corruptor1, $g.corruptor2, $g.guard], {trait: 'breast_huge'})>>
<<set _dom = setup.selectUnit([$g.corruptor1, $g.corruptor2, $g.guard], {trait: 'per_dominant'})>>
<<set _sub = setup.selectUnit([$g.corruptor1, $g.corruptor2, $g.guard], {trait: 'per_submissive'})>>

<<if _demon>>
The demon took great interest in <<rep _demon>>, a pure-bred demon under your employ.
<<elseif _racedemon>>
The demon took interest in <<rep _racedemon>>, who once resided in the land beyond
<<lore concept_mist>>.
<<elseif _mist>>
The demon was apparently familiar with <<rep _mist>>, who used to frequent
<<lore concept_mist>>.
<<elseif _sex>>
The demon was quite intrigued by <<rep _sex>>, and how such a sex-addled <<urace _sex>>
could still work under your employ.
<<elseif _dick>>
The demon was drawn to <<reps _dick>> <<udick _dick>>.
<<elseif _breast>>
The demon was drawn to <<reps _breast>> <<ubreasts _breast>>.
<<elseif _dom>>
The demon was naturally attracted to <<reps _dom>> dominance tendencies.
<<elseif _sub>>
The demon was naturally attracted to <<reps _sub>> submissive tendencies.
<</if>>

The presence of such powerful
creature in your company will surely be useful for your slaving career.
</p>


:: Quest_mist_merge_complete23Success [nobr]
<p>
Even with the assistance of <<yourrep $g.corruptor1>> and <<rep $g.corruptor2>>,
there were simply too many factors to consider that the ritual was somehow cut short.
Only half of the demonic essence managed to get transferred into the sacrificial slave,
which means that <<they $g.halfpossessed >> still retain control of <<their $g.halfpossessed>> body.
Their personality, on the other hand, was completely erased and replaced by that of the demon. It
was then really easy for <<rep $g.corruptor1>> to <<uadv $g.corruptor1>>
invite <<rep $g.halfpossessed>> to join your company, given <<their $g.halfpossessed>> new
predisposition towards lunacy.
</p>


:: Quest_mist_merge_complete23Failure [nobr]
<p>
Even with the combined knowledge of both your slavers and the powerful dark wizard,
the ritual failed, makred with
the sudden burst of otherworldly tentacles surrounding the ritual chamber.
They ravaged every orifice the tentacles could catch,
corrupting both the wizard and your slavers. Fortunately for you, your
slavers were not deemed the most juicy target in the room, since they were only
assisting the wizard. While your slavers escaped with only slight corruptions,
the wizard was twisted beyond recognition. Not
wanting to anger whatever power was ravaging the wizard, your
slavers made the wise decision to escape the place in the first opportunity.
</p>


:: Quest_mist_merge_complete23Disaster [nobr]
<p>
Despite having the best of intentions, your slavers messed up the
ritual badly, and somehow switched the corruption target from the sacrificial
slave into <<yourrep $g.guard>> instead.
Within moments, <<rep $g.guard>> writhed and moaned in a combination of agony and ecstacy.
Unable to do anything, your slavers watched as <<their $g.guard>> body twisted, wings
growing out of <<their $g.guard>> back while
<<if $g.guard.isHasDick()>>
demonic scales started to form on <<their $g.guard>> breasts.
<<else>>
<<their $g.guard>> dick deformed into those suitable for demons.
<</if>>
In the end, <<rep $g.guard>> guard|was completely possessed by the
demonic creature.
To make matters worse, the demon refused to join your company, for
they already have all of <<reps $g.guard>> memory with them and found your
company's activity to be rather boring.
</p>
