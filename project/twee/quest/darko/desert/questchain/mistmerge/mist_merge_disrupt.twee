<<include 'Opportunity_mist_merge'>>

<p>
You have chosen to disrupt the ritual and make the world a slightly better place.
</p>


:: Quest_mist_merge_disrupt2Crit [nobr]
<p>
Your slavers arrived at the nick of time as the victim's body was just about
to get ravaged by the demonic magic.
Armed with <<their $g.warrior>> trusty <<uweapon $g.warrior>>,
<<yourrep $g.warrior>> <<uadv $g.warrior>> subdued the wizard while <<rep $g.purifier1>>
and <<rep $g.purifier2>> <<uadv $g.purifier1>>
got to work and attempted to undo the corruption.

<<set _kind = setup.selectUnit([$g.purifier1, $g.purifier2], {trait: 'per_kind'})>>
<<set _honorable = setup.selectUnit([$g.purifier1, $g.purifier2], {trait: 'per_honorable'})>>
<<set _priest = setup.selectUnit([$g.purifier1, $g.purifier2], {trait: 'bg_priest'})>>
<<if _priest>>
<<Rep _priest>> recalled <<their _priest>> past as a priest and gave the prayer <<their _priest>> all,
<<elseif _kind>>
<<Reps _kind>> sincere prayers was answered
<<elseif _honorable>>
<<Reps _honorable>> honorable prayers was answered
<<else>>
The higher powers
answered to their prayers
<</if>>
and the corruptions somehow were all
transferred back into the wizard.
With the victim released from the spell, your
slavers breathed a sigh of relief as the ritual was completely disrupted,
leaving only the corrupted body of the wizard as proof that it ever took
place.
After looting the tower clean, your slavers <<uadv $g.purifier1>> took <<rep
$g.corrupted>> as a trophy home of their succesful purification attempt.
</p>


:: Quest_mist_merge_disrupt2Success [nobr]
<p>
By the time your slavers arrived, the ritual had already been completed.
Your slavers watched as the wizard finished conversing with what appeared to be a demon.
<<if $gOutcome == 'success'>>
Seeing your slavers, the demon disappeared into bats while the wizard, using their newly acquired
knowledge, teleported away. Your slavers were disappointed in the failure, but
at least they were free to <<uadv $g.purifier1>>
loot the place. They could only pray that the demon would not cause too much havoc in the vicinity.
<<else>>
Noticing your slavers, the demon went on the offensive charged at them.
<<Yourrep $g.warrior>> did <<their $g.warrior>> best protecting your other
slavers as <<rep $g.purifier1>> and <<rep $g.purifier2>> attempted to cast
whatever purification magic they could muster.
But the demon was too powerful for your slavers, and <<they $g.corrupted>>
injured <<rep $g.warrior>>,
<<if $gOutcome == 'failure'>>
before proceeding to corrupt your purifiers.
Your slavers managed to return home, but suffering from injuries and corruptions.
<<else>>
before proceeding to ravage all of your slavers. By the end of
the debauchery, your slavers had been completely corrupted,
but if there was any consolation, at least their personalities remain
intact.

<<rep $g.purifier2>> attempted to cast whatever purification magic they can.
