:: QuestDeliveryService [nobr]

<p>
The eastern nomads are known for their prowess in riding and taming horses.
Amongs the multiple clans in the east, there is one in particular which specializes
in training people as ponies. These clans raise their ponies to be a hardy,
bulky, and obedient steed and relies largely on them for their transportation and work.
The steeds in those villages can usually be seen in the village center either being
parked or being used to transport some goods. These steeds always wear their
standard pony gear at all times -- a bit gag, a pony plug, and a pair of arm/leg hooves.
Some more kinky owners like to decorate their ponies too with nipple clamps and chastity
devices.
</p>

<p>
A client has come forward to you asking to help deliver an important cargo to the leader
of the clan.
<<They $g.client>> specifically wants your slavers to deliver the cargo using one of your pony slaves,
to show <<their $g.client>> goodwill for the clan.
You can take the offer and give your pony slaves some fresh air in the deserts,
but a journey to the <<lore region_desert>> will surely take a little while.
</p>

  <<if $g.pony.isMale()>>
  <<else>>
    <<questimage 'delivery_service_female.jpg'>>
  <</if>>

<p>
Your slavers and their pony slave arrived at the nomad camp earlier than expected.
They <<uadv $g.trader1>>
delivered the cargo to the leader of the encampment, who appreciated the gesture of sending it
via a well-bred pony slave.
As a bonus reward, your slavers were given a particularly kinky pony gear courtesy of the settlement,
which could be used as a reward or punishment for your pony slave.
Before heading back, your slavers spent some time looking around the camp,
observing some the camp's pony trainers training their newer and freshly captured
ponies to properly trot.
<<set _cruel = setup.selectUnit([$g.trader1, $g.trader2, $g.trainer], {trait: 'per_cruel'})>>
<<if _cruel>>
  <<Rep _cruel>> cruelly smirked as <<they _cruel>> watched one of the pony-in-training yelped
  through its gag as it was whipped for being too slow on the trot.
<</if>>

<<set _kind = setup.selectUnit([$g.trader1, $g.trader2, $g.trainer], {trait: 'per_kind'})>>
<<if _kind>>
  <<Rep _kind>> could not watch anymore as the kind slaver was not completely fine watching
  others suffer like that.
<</if>>

</p>


:: QuestDeliveryServiceSuccess [nobr]

<p>
Your slavers and their pony slave arrived at the nomad camp as scheduled.
The leader of the encampment were happy to receive the cargo <<uadv $g.trader1>>
delivered in a way that fully respects
their traditions, and sent <<their $g.client>> good regards to your client.
Before heading back, your slavers spent some time looking around the camp,
and observing some the camp's pony trainers training their newer ponies to properly trot.
</p>


:: QuestDeliveryServiceFailure [nobr]

<p>
Unfortunately, by the time your slavers and <<rep $g.pony>> arrived at the camp,
the nomads had already moved on to a different location. It seemed that <<rep $g.pony>>
pony|was just not fast enough. You made a mental note to punish the slave later.
</p>


:: QuestDeliveryServiceDisaster [nobr]

<p>
Unfortunately, <<rep $g.pony>> collapsed from exhaustion in the middle of the trip,
and your slavers had no choice but to bring <<them $g.pony>> back home to recover.
Perhaps <<their $g.pony>> pony training requires a refresher.
</p>
