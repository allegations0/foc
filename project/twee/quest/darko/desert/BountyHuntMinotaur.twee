:: QuestBountyHuntMinotaur [nobr]

<p>
Minotarus -- a half-man half-bull monsters living in the <<lore region_desert>>.
Although they have the figure of a humanlik, their thoughts consists of nothing
but plunging their massive rod into their next victim.
Such a horny creature poses constant threat onto the nearby settlements, and
occasionally bounties are posted to scare them away.
Bounties that you can take, as long as your slavers remain vigilant throughout the quest.
</p>


:: QuestBountyHuntMinotaurCrit [nobr]

<p>
Your slavers managed to
<<uadv $g.merc1>> shoo away these minotaurs from around the nearby settlements
without using any violence.
For such splendid work,
<<if $g.negotiator.isHasTrait('per_sly')>>
as well as via <<reps $g.negotiator>> slyly delivered persuasions,
<</if>>
the settlements were more than happy to pay your 
slavers an extra bonus.
</p>

:: QuestBountyHuntMinotaurSuccess [nobr]

<p>
Your slavers happened upon one such
minotaur in the middle of assaulting an unlucky traveler.
They were momentarily
mesmerized by the size of the minotaur's dick, before
<<uadv $g.merc1>> reminded the team of
their original mission and proceed to defeat and shoo away the beast from the land.
The traveler was certainly grateful for your help, and although your slavers accepted
the thanks, they did not do so out of the kindness of their hearts.
When the traveler handed over a pouch of thank-you-gold, your slavers
<<set _greedy = setup.selectUnit([$g.merc1, $g.merc2, $g.negotiator], {trait: 'per_frugal'})>>
<<if _greedy>>
(and especially the greedy bastard that is <<rep _greedy>>)
<</if>>
smiled much more sincerely.
</p>

:: QuestBountyHuntMinotaurFailure [nobr]

<p>
Unfortunately, your slavers were lost in the vast <<lore region_desert>>.
With no minotaur in sight, they gave up after two weeks and returned to your fort.
</p>

:: QuestBountyHuntMinotaurDisaster [nobr]

<p>
Happening upon one such minotaur in the middle of assaulting an unlucky traveler,
your slavers were completely mesmerized by the size of the minotaur's dick.
As the slavers all fell in their own fantasies, they did not realize when the
minotaur, having completely filled the unlucky traveler with its sperm,
turned its gaze into your slavers and proceeded to breed them one by one.
Your slavers would need some time to recover from such ordeal, although to be
fair it was probably their own fault to begin with.
