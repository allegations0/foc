<p>
After scouring through history books on how slaves were broken in the past,
there was one common thing that seems to guarantee success: bargain with the
demons of <<lore concept_mist>>. If one knows where to look in the history books, there
are numerous records of heroic warriors who were sent into <<lore concept_mist>> and came
out as a slut, having been trained extensively by the demon's numerous cruel
devices.
</p>

<p>
If you have some contacts in the land beyond <<lore concept_mist>>, you could perhaps ask
them to take in <<yourrep _u>> for a few weeks. Granted, the demons will
likely take this request in exchange for the favor they owed you, but
having an opportunity to break the defiant mind of <<rep _u>> is not
something you can just easily pass. Still, you have heard rumors about the
unspeakable torture the demons would inflict upon those unlucky mortal, and
you can only imagine what kind of trauma <<rep _u>> will end up <<dangertext 'permanently'>>
with should you go through with this idea...

  <<questimage "bargain_with_the_devil_male.jpg">>
<</if>>

<p>
Having secured a bargain with your demonic contact, your team arrived at the
predetermined location — an ancient ruins in the middle of nowhere in the
<<lore region_desert>>. Once there, <<rep $g.negotiator>> could suddenly feel the air shifted
as a demonic portal formed before your slavers' eyes. From within, a demon
<<lady $g.demon>> clad in full latex gear came out, with
<<their $g.demon>> pet mortal, an
<<if $g.slave.isMale()>>
utterly handsome and well built male dressed in nothing but a collar and a leash,
<<else>>
utterly beautiful and well-toned female dressed in nothing but a collar and a leash,
<</if>>
surely part of <<their $g.demon>> training for breaking <<yourrep $g.slave>>.
Seeing the cruel grin in the demonic lady's face, <<rep $g.guard1>> swore that
<<they $g.guard1>> saw fear starting to form in the defiant slave's eyes, but
before long both the demon and <<yourrep $g.slave>> vanished out of thin air.
</p>

<p>
Your slavers spent the next few weeks in the nearest city, getting themselves
as drunk as possible while having the tavern wenches serve their every needs,
trying their best not to imagine what fate they had sent <<rep $g.slave>> to.
Once a few weeks had passed, your slavers returned to the same ruins they
went to before. The demon <<lady $g.demon>> casually awaited them there, before
tossing the badly damaged body of <<rep $g.slave>>. Fearing the worst,
<<yourrep $g.negotiator>> approached the body, but to <<their $g.negotiator>>
relief, the slave was still breathing and well. But the change in <<their
$g.slave>> <<ueyes $g.slave>> was apparent:
<<if $g.slave.isHasTrait('per_stubborn')>>
there was almost no trace of the stubbornly defiant eyes the slave used to glare at your slavers with.
<<elseif $g.slave.isHasTrait('per_dominant')>>
the slave almost feels submissive, a strong contrast with <<their $g.slave>> dominant former slave.
<<elseif $g.slave.isHasTrait('per_brave')>>
there were traces of fear lining in <<their $g.slave>> eyes now, a strong
contrast from <<their $g.slave>> once brave self.
<<else>>
there were no trace of the fire of defiancy that once burned so brightly in <<their
$g.slave>> before.
<</if>>
The demon was good at <<their $g.demon>> job: the slave was left broken, damaged, but otherwise
not fully mindbroken.
As <<rep $g.guard1>> picked up the barely functional body of <<rep $g.slave>>
for the trip home, the demon
<<if $g.demon.isFemale()>>
blew your slavers a kiss
<<else>>
let out a menacing growl
<</if>>
before asking your slavers to send a message to you that the bargain had been completed, and then vanishing
into thin air.
</p>

<p>
Once back at the fort, your slave will definitely need a long rest after
these trials. But something else seems to have also broke inside the slave —
and a life-lasting trauma is going to haunt <<them $g.slave>> for the rest of
<<their $g.slave>> life... Ah well, it's not like a trauma or two is going to
affect a slave's purpose: to serve you and whoever you decide to be <<their
$g.slave>> <<master $unit.player>>.
