:: Quest_loot_the_loot [nobr]

<p>
The <<lore region_desert>> are choke-full of raiders.
News of a settlement being raided comes everyday, and in fact,
you have learned about one such unfortunate settlements
which just got freshly raided.
It is highly likely that the raiders were not thorough,
and whatever survived the raid would make an easy picking for
your slavers if you are looking for a cheap human slave.
The raiders probably already took most of the valuable slaves though, so
whatever slave you found is likely to be of lower quality.
</p>


:: Quest_loot_the_lootCrit [nobr]

<p>
Your slaver found one of the raiders who were injured during the raid and had
to recover first in the ruins of the settlement. <<They $g.raider>>
raider|was unable to fight back when your slavers
<<uadv $g.scavenger1>>
decided that the raider would make a much better slave than the rest of the
settlement's survivors.
</p>


:: Quest_loot_the_lootSuccess [nobr]

<p>The raiders were not at all thorough with the place â€” they
indulged too much in using the villagers sexually and were sloppy during the
looting.
<<set _att = setup.selectUnit([$g.scavenger1, $g.scavenger2, $g.carrier], {trait: 'per_attentive'})>>
<<if _att>>
<<Rep _att>> attentively found several buildings that are still perfectly lootable.
<</if>>
Your slavers <<uadv $g.scavenger1>>
managed to picked many of the locks and looted some of the still-locked
containers in the settlement. They also found an unfortunate villager who
they deemed sufficiently fit as a slave and brought back home.
</p>


:: Quest_loot_the_lootFailure [nobr]
<p>
Unfortunately, in an unexpected twist the ruins of the settlement were picked clean
by an unusually thorough group of raiders. On the way back,
they were attacked by several desert scorpions giving your slavers minor injuries.
</p>


:: Quest_loot_the_lootDisaster [nobr]
<p>
The raiders apparently was hiding in the village, knowing full well that it
would attract scavengers, which they hoped to enslave.
Still, your slavers were not defenseless, and after a ruthless fight managed to retreat to safety
albeit sustaining heavy injuries.
