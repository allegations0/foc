<<set _u = setup.getAnySlaver()>>
<p>
Many curiosity lies in the land beyond <<lore concept_mist>>. While most of it consists of
tools related to rough and abusive sex, some demons "prefer" a more nuanced approach to sex.
</p>

<p>
...or so <<yourrep _u>> has so <<uadv _u>> explained, while you stare at the
letter that has arrived at your fort, inviting you to participate in a gathering held by the
High Demon Society. According to the letter, your exploits have reached the
demon society, and they would be very much glad indeed if you can send a team
of slavers to attend, for the society has need of a slaving company. You have
never heard of this society before, but the letter's handwriting was
impeccable, as if written by the utmost gentle<<man $g.m1>>.
</p>

<p>
While the society has given you their address, it is a rather obscure place
within <<lore concept_mist>>. It will be incredibly difficult to actually
navigate there without getting lost in the corruption. First of all, a wizard
proficient in <<lore magic_dark>> is absolutely necessary for the task. On
top of that, a slaver familiar with navigating within <<lore concept_mist>>
is also necessary. There is no doubt mind games will be played once your
slavers arrive at their destination, and a skilled negotiator is required for
the task. A sufficiently corrupted slave is also needed to demonstrate
that your slavers are up for whatever task the demon might require.
</p>

<p>
Who knows what rewards you could possibly get from a slave order as rare as this one?
</p>

<<if $g.slave.isMale()>>
  <<questimage 'high_demon_society_male.jpg'>>
<<else>>
  <<questimage 'high_demon_society_female.jpg'>>
<</if>>

<p>
With a harrumph, <<yourrep $g.wizard>> <<uadv $g.wizard>> opened the gate for
<<rep $g.navigator>> and <<utheirrel $g.navigator $g.member>> <<rep
$g.member>> to enter together with the slave <<rep $g.slave>>. But this was
merely the start of your slavers journey inside <<lore concept_mist>>, and
<<rep $g.wizard>> must hold the fort all the while <<their $g.wizard>>
teammates ventured inside the portal...
</p>

<p>
The land beyond <<lore concept_mist>> was a confusing place, with debauchery
widespread in every step your slavers took.
<<if $g.navigator.isHasTrait('race_demon')>>
But it was a familiar settings for <<therace $g.navigator>>, and
<<rep $g.navigator>> guided <<utheirrel $g.navigator $g.member>> <<rep $g.member>> throughout the
confusing place, occasionally stealing a glance or two on the
<<maiden $g.m2>> being used cruelly by the demons on the sidewalks.
<<elseif $g.navigator.isHasTrait('bg_mist')>>
But it was a familiar settings for <<yourrep $g.navigator>>, whose past
occupation were to travel in and out of <<lore concept_mist>>.
<<elseif $g.navigator.isHasTrait('corruptedfull')>>
But <<reps $g.navigator>> fully corrupted body was attuned to the corrupted
place, giving <<them $g.navigator>> the guidance <<they $g.navigator>>
required to navigate through the accursed place.
<<elseif $g.navigator.isHasTrait('magic_fire_master')>>
Thankfully, <<reps $g.navigator>> mastery over <<rep
setup.trait.magic_fire_master>> was enough to ward off the corruption and
illuminate the path that your slavers needed to take to reach their destination.
<<elseif $g.navigator.isHasTrait('magic_dark_master')>>
But <<rep $g.navigator>> navigator|is no stranger to corruption, and using
<<their $g.navigator>> mastery over <<rep setup.trait.magic_dark_master>>,
navigator|was able to effectively guide them into their destination.
<</if>>
After a few days of journey, they arrived at the address.
</p>

<p>
In the address stood an almost pristine mansion, contrasting the backdrop of
debauchery and corruption. After gazing in awe for a few moment, <<rep
$g.member>> regained <<their $g.member>> composure before <<uadv $g.member>>
knocking on the door.
A well-dressed demon <<lady $g.m1>> opened the door for your slavers, and
with a well practiced bow greeted your slavers before escorting them into the
ball.
</p>

<p>
On a first glance, the ball looked like a regular masked party, with masked
people walking all around chatting with each other. Well, except for the
occassional tail, wings, and tentacles that were abound, as well as several
slaves on leashes held by their owners. Keeping the slave <<rep $g.slave>>
on a short leash, <<yourrep $g.member>> prepared <<themself $g.member>> as <<they
$g.member>> entered the ball...
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit' || $gOutcome == 'success'>>

<<set _rewards = [
"money",
"favor",
"equipment",
"slaver",
"potion",
]>>

<<if !$inventory.isHasItem(setup.item.sexmanual_facesit)>>
<<run _rewards.push('sexmanual')>>
<</if>>

<<run setup.rng.shuffleArray(_rewards)>>
<<set _received = [_rewards[0], _rewards[1]]>>
<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
<<run _received.push(_rewards[2])>>
<</if>>

<p>
<<Yourrep $g.member>> <<uadv $g.member>> navigated through the various
conversations taking place in the ball, and while each appeared innocuous on
the surface, <<rep $g.member>> member|was fully aware that every single word
carried a bigger meaning than they conveyed. It would just take a single wrong
word to come out from <<them $g.member>> for everything to fall apart. But
<<rep $g.member>> member|was sufficiently capable for the job, and member|was able to
navigate through the endless deception.
</p>

<<for _rew range _received>>
<p>
<<if _rew == 'money'>>
During one of <<their $g.member>> conversations, <<rep $g.member>> secured a
very strong deal for exchanging one of your more corrupted slaves with a
great sum of money. <<Rep $g.member>> had to basically hold their breath
throughout the exchange with the intimidating masked <<lady $g.member>>,
holding a leash to a humanlike puppy so muscular it could not have been
natural.
<<elseif _rew == 'favor'>>
<<rep $g.member>> managed to secure some time with a young demon noble â€” or
at least a demon noble that appeared young. The noble agreed to exchange a
particularly corrupted slave from your compound in exchange for <<their
$g.m2>> endorsement of your company. While this sounded like a scam, <<rep
$g.member>> managed to convince you that the noble was the real deal.
<<elseif _rew == 'equipment'>>
<<rep $g.member>> member|was approached by a muscle-bound demon, who asked for
a sufficiently corrupted slave to replace <<their $g.m2>> broken ones. In
exchange, the demon blacksmith, as it turned out,
offered some of <<their $g.member>> creations
to your slavers â€” rare equipments from beyond <<lore concept_mist>>.
<<elseif _rew == 'slaver'>>
<<rep $g.member>> member|was approached by something that was best described as
a creature. The creature was shrouded in darkness, and <<yourrep $g.member>> member|was not able to
discern nor hear the creature, but somehow at the end of the "conversation",
<<they $g.member>> had a slave order in <<uhand $g.member>>, with no memory how the
order was negotiated or formed...
<<elseif _rew == 'potion'>>
<<rep $g.member>> caught the attention of a certain sadistic <<succubus
$g.m1>>, who delights in nothing more but breaking a slave again and again.
Looking to expand <<their $g.m1>> slave repertoire, <<they $g.m1>> offered
your slaver to purchase a slave from your company, in exchange for
<<if $inventory.isHasItem(setup.item.technology_blank)>>
the rare and elusive <<rep setup.item.technology_blank>>.
<<else>>
a large amount of <<rep setup.item.blank_potion>>.
<</if>>
Truly a deal your slaver could not refuse...
<<else>>
The host â€” a strange half-demon half-<<if
$settings.bannedtags.furry>>human<<else>>werewolf<</if>> <<man $g.m2>> â€”
personally greeted your slaver. As a thank you for coming, <<they $g.m2>>
kindly offered to purchase a slave from your company, in exchange for an
elusive tome, the <<rep setup.item.sexmanual_facesit>>. As the host busily
attended to the other participants, your slaver pondered on the order at hand...
<</if>>
</p>

<<run setup.qc.SlaveOrderHighDemonCommunity(_rew).apply($gQuest)>>
<</for>>

<p>
After a few long hours, the ball drew to a close. With several slave orders
at hand, <<yourrep $g.member>> returned to where <<rep $g.navigator>> had
<<uadv $g.navigator>> waited for <<their $g.member>> return, before traveling
back through the corruption and into the portal. They eventually arrived back
at your fort, somehow suffering no corruptions despite their long stay in
<<lore concept_mist>>. Perhaps this too was thanks to the High Demon Society?
</p>

<<else>>
<p>
After a long while, <<rep $g.member>> returned from the ball to the waiting
<<rep $g.navigator>>, seemingly happy with their work, with
<<if $gOutcome == 'failure'>>
a slave order
<<else>>
two slave orders
<</if>>
to their name.
Your slavers eventually returned back home, and only then they realize that
they had been duped by demons.
The slave orders they had secured was nothing but scams, with fine-prints all abound the
slave order. After calculating, it seems you will make a profit of a mere
<<money 15>> from the order. To make matters worse, were you to disregard the
slave order all along, you will no doubt greatly raise the ire of the demons,
which is never a wise thing to do...
</p>

<p>
<<Rep $g.member>> never realized <<they $g.member>> had been duped
until much, much later. The High Demon Society was truly a
frightening place, where they could convince even your
<<uadjgood $g.member>> slaver that such a terrible deal was beneficial for the
company. There is nothing you can do now except to bear through the deal, and
hope that next time you will get a better one.
</p>
