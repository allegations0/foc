:: Quest_capturethe_protagonist [nobr]

<p>
The <<lore region_desert>> are full of the unknown and unexplored ruins. This makes
it a prime destination for adventuring companies, and many adventurer groups
set out to the desert in search of fame and glory.
</p>

<p>
You have heard of a relatively new but particularly well equipped adventuring
company who just went into the deserts. Their trail is still fresh, and if you
want you can send a group of slavers to try and trail them, in hope of
stealing their gear and pawning them off. If you are lucky, you might even
catch yourself some new rare breed of adventuring slave.
</p>

<p>
To match these adventurers in combat, you will need a typical adventurer
team. A tank, to bait their attackers, a healer to keep the tank healthy, and
a damager to incapacitate the enemy.
</p>


:: Quest_capturethe_protagonistCrit [nobr]

<p>
Your slavers were able to pick up the trail easily enough -- these adventurers
were still green, and it showed.
<<set _att = setup.selectUnit([$g.tank, $g.dps, $g.healer], {trait: 'per_attentive'})>>
<<set _dreamy = setup.selectUnit([$g.tank, $g.dps, $g.healer], {trait: 'per_dreamy'})>>
<<if _att>>
<<Reps _att>> attentiveness means <<theslaver _att>> never failed to notice the next camping spots,
and
<<elseif _dreamy>>
<<Rep _dreamy>> did not help much with the tracking (given how inattentive <<therace _dreamy>> is),
but the other slavers were able to pick up the slack, and
<<else>>
A few abandoned campfires were passed by until a recent footsteps in the deserts was visible,
and
<</if>>
soon enough the party was in view.
Your slavers found the adventurers resting near an empty oasis. Your slavers waited until the night fall
before <<uadv $g.tank>> launching a sudden attack on the encampment as you see them
strip to bathe in the oasis.
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
<p>
The adventurers, being new, were caught completely off guard and were not able to put up any fight
at all.
But the leader of the adventurer company selflessly bought 
<<their $g.leader>> friends some time to escape.
</p>

<p>
As a result, your slavers were able to subdue the leader alone.
They bound the still naked leader, to be carried home as a prize, but not before
looting the campsite and pawning everything of value found there, as well as taking
one of the more valuable-looking piece of armor.
</p>

<<else>>

<p>
Despite them being naked with their genitals lewdly flopping around,
the adventurers were able to put up a decent fight, until at one point their hedge
wizard was able to cast a teleportation spell, teleporting the adventurers to
safety. With nobody around the campsite anymore, your slavers got to work and
stripped the encampment of anything of value. They sold most of the valuables
before coming back with the money and a particularly valuable piece of gear that
they decided to keep.
</p>

<</if>>


:: Quest_capturethe_protagonistFailure [nobr]

<p>
Your slavers were able to pick up the trail easily enough.
After a few days of traversing the trail, they found the
adventurers resting near an empty oasis.
But the adventurers managed to spot
your slavers, and a decisive battle ensued.
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'failure'>>
<p>
<<Rep $g.tank>> tried <<their $g.tank>> best to withstood all the enemy
attacks while <<rep $g.healer>> healed as much as possible from behind.
But it was not enough.
A stray arrow caught <<rep $g.healer>> in its wake and soon after
your slaver's formation were thrown into disarray. Seeing no hope to recover,
your slavers immediately retreated back to safety. Fortunately for them, the
adventurers did not give chase, and your slavers were free to recover from
their injuries back at the fort.
</p>
<<else>>

<p>
Your slavers stood no chance as the adventurer's resident wizard overwhelmed <<reps
$g.tank>> defenses. Soon enough all three of your slavers were at the
adventurer's mercy, who decided to strip them naked and used them as the sexual
playthings for the next few nights. After few long nights of being used as toys,
they released your slavers except one that the adventurers had grown attached to and decided
to keep as a pet and a mascot.
