:: Quest_rescuefor_profit [nobr]

<p>
One of the villages on the eastern settlement is offering bounty for the safe
return of their leader's <<daughter $g.slave>>.
While saving others is basically the opposite of your company's work, the
bounty this time is quite a lucrative amount of money.
In addition to that, doing occasional
honest work such as this one is always a good opportunity to become closer
with the people living in these settlements.
You can send a group of slavers to rescue the <<daughter $g.slave>>, should you wish.
</p>


:: Quest_rescuefor_profitCrit [nobr]

<p>
Led by <<rep $g.infiltrator1>>, your slavers <<uadv $g.infiltrator1>>
sneaked into the orc's encampment. The place was covered in a
permanent smell of alcohol and cum, and numerous cumstains were present
throughout the place. By the time your slavers sneaked in,
most of the orcs there were already soundly asleep from the debauchery
in the previous night — in fact, some still have their dicks up some slave's asses.
Not wanting to waste time before they wake,
<<set _cautious = setup.selectUnit([$g.infiltrator1, $g.infiltrator2, $g.thief], {trait: 'per_cautious'})>>
<<if _cautious>>
<<rep _cautious>> cautiously warned <<their _cautious>> teammates to hurry and
got to work, scouring
<<else>>
your slavers got to work and scoured
<</if>>
the camp looking for the lost <<daughter $g.slave>>.
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>

<p>
Your slavers ultimately found the <<girl $g.slave>> inside a cage at the back of the
encampment. It seemed that they were lucky to have arrived so soon, as the <<girl $g.slave>>
still appeared unmolested, or at least as they eye could see.
<<Yourrep $g.thief>> hurriedly picked the cage's lock, before escaping the place together
with <<name $g.slave>>.
</p>

<<elseif $gOutcome == 'success'>>

<p>
Your slavers ultimately found the <<girl $g.slave>> chained to a post at the end
of the encampment. It seemed that the camp leader kept <<them $g.slave>> as
their own personal-use-only slave, so compared to the utterly broken slaves scattered
throughout the encampment, the poor <<daughter $g.slave>> slave|was still moderately sane.
Your slaver quickly unchained <<them $g.slave>>, and to prevent the <<urace $g.slave>>
from making too much noises, aptly gagged <<them $g.slave>> before smuggling <<them $g.slave>> out.
</p>

<<else>>

<p>
Your slavers ultimately found the <<girl $g.slave>> at one of the "slave dumps" —
a lovingly named place where the orcs store their slaves after heavy use to
recover.
With effort, they managed to pull the <<urace $g.slave>> out of the pile.
The cum-soaked <<urace $g.slave>> appeared to have been completely broken —
<<their $g.slave>> gaze kept wandering, fixed on a faraway place.
Still, a job is a job and your slavers smuggled the slave out of the encampment.
</p>

<</if>>

<p>
Normally, this would be where your slavers present the new slave collar to
their prospective slave. But this is a rescue mission for once, and instead they
returned <<name $g.slave>> back to <<their $g.slave>> village.

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
The grateful village elder showered your slavers with gifts, as well as promise to tell
their neighbors about the good deeds performed this time of your company.

<<elseif $gOutcome == 'success'>>
The village elder was shocked at the state of their <<daughter $g.slave>>,
who slave|was almost completely broken from much abuse.
Still, a promise was a promise and he gave your slavers the promised rewards.

<<else>>
But the village elder, in what seemed to be a denial, refused to acknowledge
the <<urace $g.slave>> as his <<daughter $g.slave>>.
After a long argument, your slavers were kicked out of the settlement together with
the <<girl $g.slave>>. Your slavers gave up
getting the original rewards, and decided that <<rep $g.slave>> might just make a sufficient
alternative reward.
<</if>>
</p>


:: Quest_rescuefor_profitDisaster [nobr]
<p>
Your slavers were discovered when attempting to sneak into the orc's camp.
They tried to escape, and while <<rep $g.infiltrator1>> and <<rep $g.thief>>
were lucky to find a way to do so, <<rep $g.infiltrator2>> infiltrator2|was not as lucky.
The orcs descended upon <<them $g.infiltrator2>> and grabbed <<them $g.infiltrator2>>
by the legs, before throwing and caging <<them $g.infiltrator2>> in the slave dump together with many other
already-broken slaves.
Your slavers had to risk their lives and their purities to save <<yourrep $g.infiltrator2>>.
</p>
