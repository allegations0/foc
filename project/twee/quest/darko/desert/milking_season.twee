:: Quest_milking_season [nobr]

<p>
Among the various clothing materials available in <<lore geo_mestia>>, the soft yet
durable silk is one of the rarest and most sought-after materials. Clothings made from silk is
especially suitable for ranger-related duties. It is said that these silk are produced
at many farms in the <<lore region_desert>>, through secret techniques passed from
generation to generation. There are very few people who are privy to how these silks were actually produced.
</p>

<p>
Every now and then, during harvesting seasons, these farms may open up
opportunities for part-timers to help them harvest the silks. For such a
standard work, the pay is unusually high, and there is potential bonus of
getting one of the silk-weaved clothes. You can try to send a group of
slavers to help with this menial but potentially very rewarding task.
But there must be a reason why such a seemingly easy job pays so well...
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'failure'>>

<p>
Unfortunately, by the time your slavers arrived at the farm, the harvesting
season was already over. Your slavers had no choice but to go back to the
fort, but they swore there was something completely wrong about these silks.
</p>

<<else>>

<p>
Your slavers arrived at the farm, whose outwards appearance betrayed no hint
of what lied beyond. An old-looking barn just like any other farm, but one
thing stood out â€” located in the middle of a desert, there was simply no place
to plant crops.
<<set _curious = setup.selectUnit([$g.milker1, $g.milker2, $g.negotiator], {trait: 'per_curious'})>>
<<if _curious>>
  <<Rep _curious>>, being curious, looked even more around and yet only found more questions
  as to how the farm functions.
<</if>>
</p>

<p>
The farm operators explained to your slavers what had to be done. There were
silk cocoons that they needed to harvest at the back of the farm. These cocoons are only
harvested once per year, and so during harvesting seasons such as this the
amount work became high enough to warrant the extra labor.
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'disaster'>>

<p>
By the time your slavers had finished the work and came back, <<rep
$g.negotiator>> negotiator|was nowhere to be found. Somehow, <<rep
$g.milker1>> and <<rep $g.milker2>> did not feel any need at all to
investigate, and meekly accepted their pay and moved on.
</p>

<p>
While you have no idea what fate could possible await <<rep $g.negotiator>>,
given the mystery of the farm's growing set of cocoons and their "tap", there
was little left to imagination what could possibly happened to <<rep $g.negotiator>>...
</p>

<<else>>

<p>
Hence your slavers went to the back barn, and began their work. They managed
to harvest <<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
high quality silk, which earned your company an extra reward.
<<else>>
the silk without any problem.
<</if>>
Your
slavers then went back to fort, succeeding in their tasks.
</p>

<p>
Having read such an undetailed report, you later asked your slavers for more
information.
<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
Your slavers
were being extremely vague about what exactly the harvesting procedure is,
but apparently you managed to gather that in the back of the barn, there were numerous
cocoons all hanging from the ceilings wrapped in what appears to be silk.
Each cocoon had a tap that your slavers had to harvest from, but the quality
apparently differed based on how experienced your slavers were. They
<<uadv $g.negotiator>>
refused to say more about the subject, including the details of these
cocoons. Having seen no benefit in pursuing further, given the quality of
their job you dropped the subject and moved on to your other work.
<<else>>
Your slavers <<uadv $g.negotiator>>
refused to talk more, but you get the feeling that something in the barn had
completely unnerved even your slavers. You decided not to push the issue and move on with your day.
