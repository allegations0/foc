:: Quest_mobile_brothel [nobr]
<p>
The <<lore region_desert>> has only a few permanent settlements â€”
which means that finding a whorehouse becomes a problem for these people.
But there certain brothels operate a moving brothel service --
a particularly strong slave is made to carry a carriage containing
many whores between settlements. Settlers can then pay money to use the carriage's
contents, which usually consists of slutty and well-behaved slaves.
</p>

<p>
Among these slaving troupes, there is a particular troupe famous for
having the highest quality sluts. While your slavers entertained the idea
of using their services, you are more interested in seeing if they are
interested in buying your stock. Rumors is that they pay very good money for high
quality slaves, which are rather difficult to obtain. To secure such a deal,
it is necessary to bring your best promotional goods to showcase as an example, so that
they can see how proficient your company is in raising slaves.
</p>


:: Quest_mobile_brothelCrit [nobr]
<p>
Your slavers spotted the caravan travelling across the desert. The first
thing they saw of course was the
muscular slave almost entirely naked pulling a carriage covered in drapes.
<<if $g.puller.isHasVagina()>>
Her breasts and vagina were both pierced and connected with a chain to a collar on her neck.
<<else>>
His cock and nipples were both pierced with thick rings, which were connected with a chain to his neck.
<</if>>
Hanging from the chains were round metal weights, that swung back and forth
with every step that <<they $g.puller>> took.
</p>

<p>
After seeing the depravity, as well as the slogan on the drapes,
your slavers were sure that the <<mistress $g.madam>> is the target they had
been looking for. When your slavers
approached, with a well practiced bow the <<mistress $g.madam>> greeted your slavers and
proceeded to use <<their $g.madam>> practiced sale pitch to offer <<their
$g.madam>> slaves for your slavers perusal.
</p>

<p>
Your slavers managed to focus however, and ignore the various high-quality
<<girl $g.show>>s writhing inside the cage.
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit' or $gOutcome == 'success'>>

<p>
They managed to negotiate with the <<mistress $g.madam>>, who was more than
happy to add more quality slaves to <<their $g.madam>> troupe.

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
<<Yourrep $g.trader>>
managed to negotiate an excellent deal that would yield your company a lot of
money should you find the right slave be sold.
<<else>>
With both parties happy with the deal, your slavers returned home with a new
slave order while the <<master $g.madam>> continued <<their $g.madam>> journey,
whipping <<their $g.madam>> strong pony slave to resume the journey under the hot sun.
<</if>>
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>

<p>
As a complimentary gift, the <<master $g.madam>> allowed your slavers to use
<<their $g.madam>> stock before they go back to your fort.
<<set _lustful = setup.selectUnit([$g.trainer1, $g.guard, $g.trader], {trait: 'per_lustful'})>>
<<set _chaste = setup.selectUnit([$g.trainer1, $g.guard, $g.trader], {trait: 'per_chaste'})>>
<<if _lustful>>
<<Rep _lustful>> jumped at the opportunity to use such high-quality slaves in the carriage.
<<elseif _chaste>>
<<Rep _chaste>> hesitated, but eventually got goaded by <<their _chaste>> teammates to
just accept the rare opportunity to use such prestigious slaves.
<<else>>
Your slavers did not hesitate at all to use the high-quality slaves in the carriage.
<</if>>
Even the muscular and heavily pierced pony slave was available for use.
</p>

<<else>>

<p>
Unknown to you, your slavers actually managed to scrounge
up some money to make use of the high-quality slaves the <<mistress $g.madam>>
had to offer.
</p>

<</if>>

<<else>>

<p>
They tried to negotiate a deal to sell your slaves to <<their $g.madam>>
troupe, but the <<mistress $g.madam>> was less than impressed by both your
slavers and the sample slave they brought.
Ultimately, your slavers were unable to
make a deal with <<them $g.madam>>, and was forced to come back empty-handed.
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'disaster'>>
<p>
Worse, your slavers in the end were unable to resist the full temptation of
the <<mistress $g.madam>>'s slaves and decided to use the company's money to
fund their degenerate acts of pleasure upon the slaves. At least it was worth it,
according to your slavers.
