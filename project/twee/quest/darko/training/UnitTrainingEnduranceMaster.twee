<p>
The final culminating skill that endurance slaves need to learn is
the ability to be installed as a furniture permanently.
Be it as a living statue, or a living footstool, once a slave
is trained in this skill, they would be able to perform such
duties while keeping a smile constantly on their face.
Acquiring such skill is without doubt difficult,
and very skilled trainers are required.
A slaver skilled in <<rep setup.trait.magic_wind_master>>
is also required, to be able to imbue the slave's restraint with magic that
will punish the slave whenever they show discomfort from being used as a furniture.
</p>

<p>
  Succeeding this training will remove <<rep setup.trait.tough_nimble>> from the slave, if any.
</p>

<p>
  Completing a master training will lock out all the other master training.
</p>

:: QuestUnitTrainingEnduranceMasterCrit [nobr]
<p>
Thanks to the skill of the training team,
the training went much smoother than expected. <<Rep $g.trainee>> trainee|is now so absolutely durable
to any prolonged period of abuse, and can be used safely as a furniture permanently.
</p>

:: QuestUnitTrainingEnduranceMasterSuccess [nobr]
<p>
<<Reps $g.trainee>> transformation into a complete endurance whore
has been completed, and they are ready to be installed wherever
you or their future master wish.
</p>

:: QuestUnitTrainingEnduranceMasterFailure [nobr]
<p>
Even after these intense trainings,
the only visible result was
<<rep $g.trainee>> sheer exhaustion that would take
weeks to fully recover from.
</p>

:: QuestUnitTrainingEnduranceMasterDisaster [nobr]
<p>
The training was a complete failure.
Not only <<rep $g.trainee>> trainee|have been reduced to a wreck,
<<rep $g.trainee>> must also redo some of the previous training
again.
</p>
