<p>
  This training will reform the slave's body so that being horny is their body's
  natural resting space.
  A slave that has completed this training will always be aroused, regardless of how
  many times they have climaxed or whatever activity they are doing.
  Having a consistently aroused slave is pleasing to some, which is why
  such high-libido slaves are valued highly in some aristocratic community.
</p>

<p>
  Completing a master training will lock out all the other master training.
</p>

:: QuestUnitTrainingHornyMasterCrit [nobr]
<p>
Thanks to the skill of the training team,
the training went much smoother than expected. <<Reps $g.trainee>> transformation into a permanently-<<hard $g.trainee>> slave
has been completed.
</p>

:: QuestUnitTrainingHornyMasterSuccess [nobr]
<p>
It is done. <<Reps $g.trainee>> transformation into a permanently-<<hard $g.trainee>> slave
has been completed.
<<if $g.trainee.isHasTrait(setup.trait.dick_tiny)>>
<<reps $g.trainee>> dick is now permanently hard, and always stand
proudly in front of them. As a slave, this dick is now <<their $g.trainee>> master's
property, to be used as the master see fit.
<<else>>
<<reps $g.trainee>> pussy is now permanently wet, and always glisten
and glow under her legs. As a slave, this pussy is now <<their $g.trainee>> master's
property, to be used as the master see fit.
<</if>>
</p>

:: QuestUnitTrainingHornyMasterFailure [nobr]
<p>
While <<rep $g.trainee>> tries <<their $g.trainee>> best to
follow the training, either through <<reps $g.trainee>> sheer
stubbornness or through <<rep $g.head>> lack of skill,
the training was not able to completely transform the slave
into a permanently-<<hard $g.trainee>> slave.
At the end of the training,
<<rep $g.head>> head|have no choice but to give up on the
training.
</p>

:: QuestUnitTrainingHornyMasterDisaster [nobr]
<p>
The training was a complete failure. To reattempt this training,
<<rep $g.trainee>> must redo some of the previous training
again.
</p>
