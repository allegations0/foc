:: QuestUnitTrainingEnduranceBasic [nobr]

<p>
While some slave owners prefer their slaves to break from use,
some find mindbroken slaves to be distasteful. These owners
often train their slaves to be able to withstand said abuse,
often with a smile on their face.
But before any of those, the slave's basic endurance must be
increased, and what better way than a couple of runs on the track?
</p>

<</if>>

<p>
The first step to become an endurance slut is to increase the slave's stamina, and what
better way than a couple of "motivated" run in your <<rep setup.buildingtemplate.trainingfield>>?
At <<reps $g.head>> command,
<<rep $g.trainee>> took off,
running as fast as <<their $g.trainee>> <<ulegs $g.trainee>> could carry <<them $g.trainee>>.
As <<they $g.trainee>> went,
<<if $g.trainee.isHasTrait('dick_huge')>>

<<their $g.trainee>> <<if $g.trainee.isHasTrait('dick_titanic')>>
ridiculous penis<<else>>huge dick<</if>>
flopped around painfully, hitting <<their $g.trainee>> thighs, but <<they $g.trainee>>
tried to ignore it.

<<elseif $g.trainee.isHasTrait('balls_huge')>>

<<their $g.trainee>>
<<if $g.trainee.isHasTrait('balls_titanic')>>
ridiculous ballsack
<<else>>
huge ballsack
<</if>>
got painfully pinched between <<their $g.trainee>> thighs, but <<they $g.trainee>> tried to ignore it.

<<elseif $g.trainee.isHasTrait('breast_huge')>>

<<their $g.trainee>>

<<if $g.trainee.isHasTrait('breast_titanic')>>
ridiculous mammaries
<<else>>
huge tits
<</if>>
bounced around painfully,
so <<they $g.trainee>> cradled <<their $g.trainee>> udders in <<their $g.trainee>> <<uarms $g.trainee>>,
trying to support them as much as possible.

<<else>>
<<their $g.trainee>> cute rear made a pretty picture.
<</if>>

<<Yourrep $g.head>> made <<rep $g.trainee>>
repeat the exercise until <<they $g.trainee>> trainee|was very tired,
<<if $g.trainee.isHasTrait('tough_tough')>>
which took quite some time,
<<elseif $g.trainee.isHasTrait('tough_nimble')>>
which didn't take that long,
<</if>>
hounding <<them $g.trainee>> mercilessly throughout,
before sending <<them $g.trainee>> to rest away.
The moment the slave recover, to <<their $g.trainee>> horror it was another track
session, and this continued on for a week...
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>

<p>
<<Reps $g.trainee>> training was a complete success, and the slave
has been toughened-up, capable of withstanding more abuse than before.
</p>

<<else>>

<p>
At the end of the week, <<rep $g.trainee>> trainee|have
became significantly more durable, and can withstand
a longer period of abuse without breaking.
</p>

<</if>>

:: QuestUnitTrainingEnduranceBasicFailure [nobr]
<p>
Unfortunately, <<rep $g.trainee>> seemed to have
significantly lower endurance threshold than most people.
Training <<them $g.trainee>> in endurance would need more
effort.
</p>

:: QuestUnitTrainingEnduranceBasicDisaster [nobr]
<p>
Either <<rep $g.head>> head|was too harsh in employing punishment,
or just pure bad luck, <<rep $g.trainee>> managed to get injured
and the training had to be stopped early.
</p>
