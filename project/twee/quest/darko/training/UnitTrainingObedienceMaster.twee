:: QuestUnitTrainingObedienceMaster [nobr]

<p>
This training will transform the slave from a free-willed humanlike
into a slave whose only purpose in life is to obey its betters without
any second thought.
Such absolute obedience can only be obtained through intense unintterupted
training, peppered with generous shocks of electricity whenever they show
any form of resistance.
This requires a slaver proficient in <<rep setup.trait.magic_wind_master>>, and
furthermore the slaver themself must be sufficiently skilled.
</p>

<p>
  Succeeding this training will remove <<rep setup.trait.per_dominant>> from the slave, if any.
</p>

<p>
  Completing a master training will lock out all the other master training.
</p>

:: QuestUnitTrainingObedienceMasterCrit [nobr]

<p>
In one of the training sessions,
<<rep $g.head>> snapped <<their $g.head>> fingers at <<rep $g.trainee>> and point commandingly
at the floor in the dungeons.
<<They $g.head>> told <<them $g.trainee>> that a proper slave does whatever
<<their $g.trainee>> dom wants, always, and without question, or <<they $g.trainee>>
will be punished. <<Rep $g.head>> left <<rep $g.trainee>> kneeling obediently beside <<them $g.head>> for some time.
Then, without preamble, <<rep $g.head>> stood up again and
<<if (!$g.head.isHasDick())>>rode <<their $g.trainee>> face
<<else>>throatfucked <<them $g.trainee>><</if>>,
intentionally ensuring that <<they $g.trainee>> gagged and struggled.
<<Rep $g.trainee>> spent almost all <<their $g.trainee>> sexual experiences as a sub for the rest of the training,
their life reduced to an endless cycle of phallus of every kind being inserted into <<their $g.trainee>>
various orifices, with no regard whatsoever to <<their $g.trainee>> own pleasure.
Whenever <<they $g.trainee>> showed any sign of discomfort, a jolt of electricity
from <<reps $g.head>> mastery over <<rep setup.trait.magic_wind_master>> came to shock
<<their $g.trainee>> nethers.
This is what a slave must do, and it is <<their $g.trainee>> fate to become one.
Even other slaves who happen to be allowed to have sex with <<them $g.trainee>> were required to use
<<them $g.trainee>>, not make love to <<them $g.trainee>>.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to the skill of the training team,
the training went much smoother than expected. <<Reps $g.trainee>> transformation into a completely submissive
slave had been completed, and is now ready to comply to any order
imaginable, and will always do it no matter how degrading or humiliating
it is, and do it with a smile on <<their $g.trainee>> face.
</p>

:: QuestUnitTrainingObedienceMasterFailure [nobr]

<p>
While <<rep $g.trainee>> tried <<their $g.trainee>> best to
follow the training, either through <<reps $g.trainee>> sheer
stubbornness or through <<reps $g.head>> lack of skill,
the training was not able to wipe out all sense of free will
from the slave.
At the end of the training,
<<rep $g.head>> head|have no choice but to give up on the
training.
</p>

:: QuestUnitTrainingObedienceMasterDisaster [nobr]
<p>
The training was a complete failure. To reattempt this training,
<<rep $g.trainee>> must redo some of the previous training
again.
</p>
