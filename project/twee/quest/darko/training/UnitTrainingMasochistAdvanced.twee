<p>
Once a slave has some basic association between pain and pleasure, the
next step is to reinforce this connection by disallowing the slave to
reach climax without some sort of pain.
This deeper connection, once made, will inevitably cause the salve
to crave some sort of punishment, which, depending on the master,
is a good or a bad thing.

<p>
<<Rep $g.trainee>> turned out to be a natural masochist.
In addition to completing the training with flying colors,
their true mascohistic nature is also revealed.
</p>

:: QuestUnitTrainingMasochistAdvancedSuccess [nobr]
<p>
It was not easy, but through both <<reps $g.trainee>> willingness,
as well as your slaver's dedications, <<rep $g.trainee>>
managed to acquire all the necessary skils to graduate from this
training.
</p>

:: QuestUnitTrainingMasochistAdvancedFailure [nobr]
<p>
Unfortunately, the training was unsuccessful, and the lessons were
lost in <<reps $g.trainee>> thick skull. Even worse, the slave needs
a week to recover from the injuries sustained during the training.
</p>

:: QuestUnitTrainingMasochistAdvancedDisaster [nobr]
<p>
Unfortunately, the lessons proved too much for <<rep $g.trainee>>.
Their now wrecked body would need to fully recover first before reattempting
this training.
