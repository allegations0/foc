<p>
Once the slave is passable as a girl, the next step is
to ensure that the slave fundamentally believes that they are no
longer a man, but a girl.
Once they have completed this training, the chastity cage is no longer
necessary, as their dick would be completely useless to them.
Some masters delight in having dickgirls who are forbidden from using
their dicks.

<p>
<<Rep $g.trainee>> turned out to be a natural sissy.
The training went so smoothly that
<<rep $g.head>> and your slavers managed to study other things
and gain a lot of experience from their spare time during the training.
</p>

<<else>>

<p>
It was not easy, but through both <<reps $g.trainee>> willingness,
as well as your slaver's dedications, <<rep $g.trainee>>
managed to acquire all the necessary skils to graduate from this
training.
</p>

<</if>>

:: QuestUnitTrainingSissyAdvancedFailure [nobr]
<p>
Unfortunately, the training was unsuccessful, and the lessons were
lost in <<reps $g.trainee>> thick skull.
</p>

:: QuestUnitTrainingSissyAdvancedDisaster [nobr]
<p>
Unfortunately, the lessons proved too much for <<rep $g.trainee>>.
It is clear that <<reps $g.trainee>> prior training must be
repeated before another attempt at this training.
