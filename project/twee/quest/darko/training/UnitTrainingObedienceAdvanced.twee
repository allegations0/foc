<p>
Once a slave learned the basic knowledge of servitude, the next step
is to instill inside their head that they can be nothing else but a slave.
While some others prefer to achieve this by breaking the slaves' mind,
some prefer this training which trains the slave by simple repetition
of the punishment and reward system.
They must learn to obey without question, and to understand their place
in the world.

<<Rep $g.trainee>> turned out to be a natural submissive. <<Rep $g.head>> even finds the training
enjoyable, if somewhat lacking in challenge.

It was close, but by the end of the training,
<<rep $g.trainee>> trainee|have fully grasp the new reality
that <<they $g.trainee>> trainee|is no longer a <<woman $g.trainee>>,
but a slave.
</p>

:: QuestUnitTrainingObedienceAdvancedFailure [nobr]

While <<rep $g.trainee>> trainee|have basic understanding of
servitude, <<their $g.trainee>> head seems incapable

unsuccessful.
</p>

:: QuestUnitTrainingObedienceAdvancedDisaster [nobr]
