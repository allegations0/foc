:: Quest_slaver_training [nobr]
<p>
While there has been several occurrences of a former slave becoming a slaver, it is still relatively rare.
For one, the slave owners are usually reluctant to give up a perfectly good slave.
More importantly, the slave, having experienced what it felt under the whip, is usually averse to having to inflict their suffering on another.
</p>

<p>
With a highly skilled slaver, however,
it might be possible to actually convince a slave to become a slaver.
It will be extremely difficult, however, and requires a specific team of slavers to do so.
Normally, this delicate procedure will leave the former slave traumatized upon joining your team,
as well as requiring a completely untrained slave.
But with the aid of your
<<rep setup.item.brainwash_technology>>,
these side effects could be completely removed.
Just make sure to keep your slavers far, far away from its mind-numbing effects.
</p>


:: Quest_slaver_trainingCrit [nobr]

<p>
Over the past two weeks, your slavers <<uadv $g.convincer1>> convinced â€”
with the subconcious help of <<rep setup.item.brainwash_technology>>,
your now former-slave <<rep $g.trainee>> the benefits of becoming a slaver.
<<Rep $g.convincer1>> <<uadv $g.convincer1>> sneaked in a drink or two for
the slave infused liberally
with <<rep setup.item.potion_slavertraining>>.
After long days of convincing, <<rep $g.trainee>> finally saw the light, and
agreed to become one of your slavers. <<Rep $g.trainee>> trainee|is now
waiting in the <<rep setup.buildingtemplate.prospectshall>> for you to
officially take in as a proper slaver.
</p>

<p>
The <<rep setup.item.brainwash_technology>> helped <<rep $g.trainee>> overcome
<<their $g.trainee>> experiences as a slave and come back a better stronger <<man $g.trainee>> than before.
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
  <p>
  Seeing <<their $g.trainee>> future secure as a slaver, <<rep $g.trainee>> gave to <<yourrep $g.head>> the location of <<their $g.trainee>> secret stash that was originally planned as <<their $g.trainee>> lifeline upon escaping from your fort.
  </p>
<</if>>

<<if $g.trainee.getWeeksWithCompany() >= 53>>
  <p>
    Despite having been a slave for quite some time, thanks to the masterful use of
    <<rep setup.item.potion_slavertraining>>, there does not seem to be any adverse
    effects on <<rep $g.trainee>>.
  </p>
<</if>>


:: Quest_slaver_trainingFailure [nobr]

<p>
Unfortunately, <<rep $g.trainee>> managed to stubbornly resist all your slavers arguments, and ultimately preferred being whipped to whipping others.
The training failed, and must be repeated if you really want the slave as a slaver.
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
<p>
During the training, some of your slavers were unfortunately affected by
their severe misuse of <<rep setup.item.brainwash_technology>>...
</p>
