<p>
This final training will allow pony slaves to be used alongside animal horses
--- after all, they occupy the same stables and must learn how to work together.
These slaves must learn how to keep up with their fellow equines, and even learn how
to take those equine dicks up their holes.
Some masters like to replace the standard whip lash with the dildo lash that they plug
deep inside the pony's ass, and thrust whenever they would whip the slave.
A true pony slave must learn and capable of doing all these difficult tasks, and hence
the training will be difficult.
</p>

<p>
  Completing a master training will lock out all the other master training.
</p>

:: QuestUnitTrainingPonyMasterCrit [nobr]
<p>
Thanks to the skill of the training team,
the training went much smoother than expected. <<Reps $g.trainee>> transformation into a permanent and dedicated pony slave
has been completed.
</p>

:: QuestUnitTrainingPonyMasterSuccess [nobr]
<p>
It is done. <<Reps $g.trainee>> transformation into a parmanent and dedicated pony slave
has been completed.
With the proper pony suit,
<<rep $g.trainee>> can now be assigned to carriages right with other animal horses,
be it as an independent mule or mounted as a dicksleeve for the horse.
</p>

:: QuestUnitTrainingPonyMasterFailure [nobr]
<p>
While <<rep $g.trainee>> tries <<their $g.trainee>> best to
follow the training, either through <<reps $g.trainee>> sheer
stubbornness or through <<rep $g.head>> lack of skill,
the training was not able to completely transform the slave
into the ultimate pony.
At the end of the training,
<<rep $g.head>> head|have no choice but to give up on the
training.
</p>

:: QuestUnitTrainingPonyMasterDisaster [nobr]
<p>
The training was a complete failure. To reattempt this training,
<<rep $g.trainee>> must redo some of the previous training
again.
