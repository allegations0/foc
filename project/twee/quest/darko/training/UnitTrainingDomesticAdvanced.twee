<p>
Once a slave has basic knowledge in housekeeping, they next must
learn all the intricacies involved in it. This involves how to
ensure that the corners of the room are squeaky clean, as well as
how to please the owners by looking good while doing these job.
With some luck, the owners may pick up their sorry bodies and
have some fun.

:: QuestUnitTrainingDomesticAdvancedCrit [nobr]

<p>
<<Rep $g.trainee>> trainee|is now a proud slave capable of
doing mundane work in the least mundane way possible. <<Rep $g.head>> and your slavers also gain a lot of experience from the training.
</p>

:: QuestUnitTrainingDomesticAdvancedSuccess [nobr]

<p>
It was not easy, but through both <<reps $g.trainee>> willingness,
as well as your slaver's dedications, <<rep $g.trainee>>
managed to acquire all the necessary skils to graduate from this
training.
</p>

:: QuestUnitTrainingDomesticAdvancedFailure [nobr]
<p>
Unfortunately, the training was unsuccesful, and the lessons were
lost in <<reps $g.trainee>> thick skull.
</p>

:: QuestUnitTrainingDomesticAdvancedDisaster [nobr]
<p>
Unfortunately, the lessons proved too much for <<rep $g.trainee>>.
It is clear that <<reps $g.trainee>> prior training must be
repeated before another attempt at this training.
