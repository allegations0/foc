<p>
When a slave has learned how to sustain a prolonged time of abuse,
the next step in masochist training is to learn how to quickly
recover from such treatment and made them available again to their
master as quickly as possible.
The master masochist training thus focuses on a repeated cycle
of intense abuse followed by recovery time.
An hour or two bound and hanged from the ceiling
followed by an hour of rest, for example.

<p>
<<Rep $g.trainee>> turns out to be a natural at being
an objectified slave.
</p>

:: QuestUnitTrainingMasochistMasterSuccess [nobr]
<p>
It was not easy, but through both <<reps $g.trainee>> willingness,
as well as your slaver's dedications, <<rep $g.trainee>>
managed to learn and apply the necessary skills and masochist required
to qualify as a graduate of this training.
Still, after such intense training, <<they $g.trainee>> would need at least
one week of rest.
</p>

:: QuestUnitTrainingMasochistMasterFailure [nobr]
<p>
Unfortunately, the training was unsuccesful.
At the end of the week, not only <<rep $g.trainee>> trainee|was exhausted,
the trainings does not seem to stick to <<them $g.trainee>> and has
to be reattempted once <<they $g.trainee>> recover.
</p>

:: QuestUnitTrainingMasochistMasterDisaster [nobr]
<p>
Unfortunately, the lessons proved too much for <<rep $g.trainee>>.
Their now wrecked body would need to fully recover first before reattempting
this training.
