:: QuestUnitTrainingMindbreak [nobr]
<p>
Some masters prefer their slaves to be nothing but a hollowed out
fucktoy. This training will do just that ---
through severe abuse, this training will transform any slave,
willing or not, into a soul-less compliant play thing.
</p>

<p>
<<dangertext 'WARNING'>>: Mindbroken slaves are worth much less than normal slaves.
</p>

:: QuestUnitTrainingMindbreakCrit [nobr]
<p>
The training was a success. Drowned in a pool of bodily fluids,
<<rep $g.trainee>> almost does not respond when being carried
away to be stored as a fucktoy for you and <<their $g.trainee>> future
master.
</p>

:: QuestUnitTrainingMindbreakSuccess [nobr]
<p>
The training was a success. Drowned in a pool of bodily fluids,
<<rep $g.trainee>> almost does not respond when being carried
away to be stored as a fucktoy for you and <<their $g.trainee>> future
master.
</p>

:: QuestUnitTrainingMindbreakFailure [nobr]
<p>
<<Reps $g.trainee>> mental strength proves too much for your
slavers that somehow <<they $g.trainee>> retained the sense of self
even after the ordeal <<they $g.trainee>> went through.
</p>

:: QuestUnitTrainingMindbreakDisaster [nobr]
<p>
<<they $g.trainee>> trainee|was wrecked again and again by your team of slavers
but it proved too much for the slave.
The training had to be stopped early and the slave to be given time to
recover.
</p>
