<p>
The final training will erase the slave's former slave, making them a perfectly
malleable toy for their owner, able to become the personality of anything their
master wishes for.
They want an addled sex toy? They get an addled sex toy. They want a
former crime fighter who fell on hard times? They'll get that and some more.
Whatever dark desires their owner might crave, the slave will be able to provide
an acting convincing enough to satisfy their owner's desires.
</p>

<p>
  Succeeding this training will remove <<rep setup.trait.per_slow>> from the slave, if any.
</p>

<p>
  Completing a master training will lock out all the other master training.
</p>

:: QuestUnitTrainingRoleplayMasterCrit [nobr]

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>

<p>
  Thanks to the skill of the training team,
  the training went much smoother than expected. <<Reps $g.trainee>> transformation into an elite master edger
  has been completed.
</p>

<<else>>

<p>
It is done. <<Reps $g.trainee>> transformation into an elite master edger
has been completed.
</p>

<</if>>

:: QuestUnitTrainingRoleplayMasterFailure [nobr]

<p>
While <<rep $g.trainee>> tries <<their $g.trainee>> best to
follow the training, either through <<reps $g.trainee>> sheer
stubbornness or through <<rep $g.head>> lack of skill,
the training was not able to completely transform the slave
into the ultimate master edger.
At the end of the training,
<<rep $g.head>> head|have no choice but to give up on the
training.
</p>

:: QuestUnitTrainingRoleplayMasterDisaster [nobr]

<p>
The training was a complete failure. To reattempt this training,
<<rep $g.trainee>> must redo some of the previous training
again.
</p>
