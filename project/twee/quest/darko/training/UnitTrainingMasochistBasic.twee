<p>
While some sadistic masters prefer their slaves to suffer from punishments,
some masters prefer slaves who are addicted to punishments.
This training teaches slaves that pleasure and pain are one and the same.
The final exam of this training is testing whether the slave can reach climax
from being tortured alone.
An intense session of reward and punishment must be applied to rewire their
brain to associate pain with pleasure.
</p>

<p>
Training a slave to be a pain slut is not an easy, gentle task, and it takes multiple training
to relink pain into pleasure.
In one of the training sessions,
<<rep $g.head>> shoved <<rep $g.trainee>> over a bench,
rubbed <<their $g.head>> <<uhand $g.head>> over
<<reps $g.trainee>> ass,
who was quivering with anticipation and fear.
<<Rep $g.trainee>> trainee|was almost beside <<themself $g.trainee>>,
shuddering at the titillation, and <<rep $g.head>> used <<their $g.head>> other <<uhand $g.head>>
to strike <<their $g.trainee>>
<<if $g.trainee.isHasDick()>>cockhead<<else>>pussylips<</if>>.
As <<rep $g.trainee>> writhed in agony, <<rep $g.head>> told <<them $g.trainee>> to get used to it
while
<<if $g.trainee.isHasDick()>>simultaneously jacking off <<their $g.trainee>> dick<<else>>
stimulating <<their $g.trainee>> clit<</if>>.
<<They $g.trainee>>'s a pain slut now, and pain sluts must get used to pain and derive pleasure from it.
<<Rep $g.trainee>> hadn't recovered from the mixture of pain and pleasure before
<<they $g.trainee>> felt the still more urgent pain of rough anal, which was overlaid by another
stimulation,
which was then overlaid by rough spanking,
gratification,
nipple pinching, orgasm, <<if $g.trainee.isHasDick()>>dick abuse<<else>>clit torture<</if>>, and the cycle
continued for an entire week.
In the end, <<their $g.trainee>> brain starts to write pain to pleasure,
and <<they $g.trainee>> trainee|have started to get off on pain, although <<their $g.trainee>> training
to be the perfect painslut is still far from over.
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
<p>
The training was a complete success. <<Reps $g.trainee>> body now subconciously associates pain with pleasure,
and will involuntarily get <<hard $g.trainee>> whenever pain was inflicted on <<them $g.trainee>>.
Your slavers also gain much experience from the session.
</p>

<<else>>

<p>
At the end of the week, <<rep $g.trainee>> can now (or at least pretend
sufficiently) derive pleasure from being inflicted with pain.
However, <<their $g.trainee>> pain threshold and <<their $g.trainee>> dedication to pain
will still need to be worked on in future sessions.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, <<reps $g.trainee>> thick skull means that
rewiring their brain will need extra efforts.
</p>

:: QuestUnitTrainingMasochistBasicDisaster [nobr]
<p>
Either <<rep $g.head>> head|was too harsh in employing punishment,
or just pure bad luck, <<rep $g.trainee>> managed to get injured
and the training had to be stopped early.
