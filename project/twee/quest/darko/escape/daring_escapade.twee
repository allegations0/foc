:: Quest_daring_escapade [nobr]

<p>
A slave of yours, <<rep $g.slave>>, had escaped your fort some time ago.
Desperate to evade your recapture, <<they $g.slave>> had opted for a very
dangerous option â€” into the <<lore region_sea>>. This venture is surely dangerous
for the slave, but it is sure effective in deterring your chase. Is the slave
worth the chase, given the dangers posed by the <<lore region_sea>>? It might be wiser to
just let the slave go at this point...
</p>

<p>
If you really want to recapture the slave, however, you will need a ship
commanded by at least a fighter and a navigator. A slave capturer would also
be nice for when the slavers finally meet <<rep $g.slave>> again.
</p>

<p>
<<dangertext 'Warning'>>: If you let this quest expire or if you remove the
quest, <<rep $g.slave>> will be gone forever...
</p>


:: Quest_daring_escapadeCrit [nobr]
<p>
Braving the <<lore region_sea>>, your slavers <<uadv $g.navigator>> ventured
south seeking the lost slave <<rep $g.slave>>. They were in luck, as <<rep
$g.slave>> had not ventured far on the small ship <<they $g.slave>>
procured. It was an easy affair having <<rep $g.pirate>> and <<rep
$g.capturer>> board the slave's ship, securing the protesting slave back into
your ship and on way to your fort.
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
<p>
Apparently <<rep $g.slave>> slave|was not the only inhabitant in their ship,
as your slaver found another passenger. There were only one possible outcome
here as your slavers collared the other passenger to begin <<their
$g.victim>> new life serving <<their $g.victim>> betters.
</p>
<</if>>


:: Quest_daring_escapadeFailure [nobr]
<p>
The <<lore region_sea>> prove too challenging for your slavers as their ship
were rocked by the heavy waves into one of the reefs.
With the crew injured, your slavers had no choice but to went back to the fort,
but at least they managed to pick up the lead on where <<rep $g.slave>> could possibly go.
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
<p>
<<Rep $g.capturer>> went missing during the chaos.
<<set _rescuer = $dutylist.getUnitIfAvailable('rescuer')>>
<<if _rescuer>>
Your rescuer <<rep _rescuer>> will have to get to work to rescue <<them $g.capturer>>.
<<else>>
Maybe you could appoint a rescuer to get the lost slaver back...
<</if>>
