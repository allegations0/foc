:: Quest_mindbroken_escapade [nobr]
<p>
<<Rep $g.slave>> slave|have escaped from your fort!
Normally, this would be much harder with any ordinary slave. But you remember
that <<rep $g.slave>> slave|have been mindbroken, and is likely just dazing
out there unsure of where <<they $g.slave>> slave|is supposed to go.
</p>

<p>
To recapture the slave, you will most likely need to gather information in
the surrounding taverns â€” whether anyone has spotted someone bearing
similarity with <<rep $g.slave>>. With luck, your slavers will be able to
locate the slave and bring <<them $g.slave>> home before anything bad befalls
<<them $g.slave>>.
</p>

<p>
Although given enough time, hunger and thirst will surely drive the mindbroken
slave back to your fort. You can ignore this quest and the slave will eventually return to your fort,
but most likely heavily malnourished.
</p>

<p>
Your slavers traveled from tavern to tavern <<uadv $g.informer1>> gathering
as much information as possible about the slave. Finally, they were informed
by a local farmer that someone suspicious had come to his farm and ate their
animals' food. That does sound like what a hungry mindbroken slave would do,
and your slavers followed the lead.
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'failure' or $gOutcome == 'disaster'>>

<p>
Arriving at the farm, there were nothing but farm animals grazing around the
fields. But <<rep $g.informer2>> found signs that <<rep $g.slave>>
slave|was here at some point, drinking and eating from the livestock through. Your slavers gathered
more information until they finally found another lead towards <<reps
$g.slave>> position, although the lead will still need to be re-pursued.
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'disaster'>>
<p>
Unfortunately, your slavers were waylaid by brigands during their way back and came back home injured.
</p>
<</if>>

<<else>>

<p>
Lo and behold, <<yourrep $g.slave>> slave|was there grazing along the other
farm animals. Your slavers <<uadv $g.informer1>> collared back the slave to
be brought to <<their $g.informer1>> usual home.
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
<p>
<<Rep $g.slave>> somehow bore some valuables with <<them $g.slave>>, unknown
from which traveler they must have liberated them from.
</p>
<</if>>
