:: Quest_healing_grove [nobr]

<p>
Several water springs in the <<lore region_forest>> are famous for their
seemingly magical ability to heal wounds.
The local residents often travel to these springs to bathe, which would heal whatever
illness and injuries they have.
As much as you would like to have your own healing spring in the fort, it
would not be possible for you to transport the spring physically into your fort.
But at least you can send a group of slavers to locate the spring and scoop
the useful water into carefully prepared bottles,
effectively making you a bunch of <<rep setup.item.healing_potion>> either for your own consumption,
or to be resold for a decent sum.
</p>

<p>
First of all, you need to send a scout to locate the surely well-hidden spring.
A biologist can help the scout the terrains to find the likely location of the spring.
Finally, an alchemist slaver is a must, for their knowledge in potion-making is required
to bottle up these water.

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
Your slavers found the spring as pristine as they were rumored to be,
with animals and butterflies frolicking around the spring.
As beautiful as the sight was, there was still money to be made and your slavers got to work.
They scooped some of the water into the many vials they brought.
Using these water,
<<rep $g.alchemist>> alchemist|was able to <<uadv $g.alchemist>>
concoct several <<rep setup.item.healing_potion_greater>>.
<<else>>
<<Rep $g.scout>> scout|was unable to lead <<utheirrel $g.scout $g.biologist>> <<rep $g.biologist>> and
<<utheirrel $g.scout $g.alchemist>> <<rep $g.alchemist>> into the rumored spring.
Just before they were about to give up,
<<rep $g.biologist>> found a smalller spring with minor healing properties.
It might not be the spring your slavers were looking for, but
<<yourrep $g.alchemist>> thought it was good enough and got to work.
They scooped some of the water into the vials they brought.
While the spring's healing properties were not as strong as the rumored one, it was still pretty
potent and
<<rep $g.alchemist>> still managed to
craft several <<rep setup.item.healing_potion>> out of them.
<</if>>

You can use these potions to immediately heal your slavers of their injuries
<<inyourbuilding 'warehouse'>>.
Or, with proper treatment, can also be used to heal even very lengthy wounds.
Alternatively, there is always demand for these potions in the market,
and they
will sell decently
<<inyourbuilding 'bazaar'>>.
</p>


:: Quest_healing_groveFailure [nobr]

<p>
Your slavers were lost in the forest when trying to find and locate the spring.
It took <<reps $g.scout>> greatest efforts to return them back to the exit.
Still, they managed to stumble upon a small spring on the way out, which turned out to
have minor healing properties, and <<rep $g.alchemist>> alchemist|was able to
<<uadv $g.alchemist>> craft something out of it.
</p>


:: Quest_healing_groveDisaster [nobr]
<p>
Unfortunately, during your slavers adventure into the forest, a sizable
earthstorm broke out and trapped your slavers in the forest. They had no choice
but to retreat after suffering numerous cuts and bruises here and there from the
upturned vegetations in the forest.
