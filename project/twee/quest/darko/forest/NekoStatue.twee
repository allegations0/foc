:: QuestNekoStatue [nobr]

<p>
In ancient times, the elves and the neko were engaged in a lengthy war.
While those empires has long gone by now, the remnants of this war are still abundantly present
in the <<lore region_forest>>.
One of the most famous ones is the so-called moai filled, where statues
of ancient neko soldiers were posed and displayed in various positions
on an empty meadow.
While the ancient elves look quite similar with the modern elves,
ancient neko often still retain strong heritage to their <<lore race_tigerkin>> ancestors.
They often look quite different than modern neko, with some sporting a full furry body or just furry limbs.
</p>

<p>
One of your contacts has informed you that those statues were supposedly
a living breathing neko once. They were in fact (if the rumors were to be believed)
neko soldiers who were defeated by the elven army, and turned into a living statue
by the elven petrification magic.
All the statues without exception are held upright with a pole seemingly shoved deep
within their asses --
Rumors said these poles ended with
a huge dildo which are stuck and lodged within their anus.
</p>

<p>
You have heard that there might still be some elven camps out there who are privy
of the rituals required to undo these spells.
While having a neko as a slave is always a good thing, and you do wonder if it is worth
risking your slavers to go on such a weird mission.
</p>


:: QuestNekoStatueCrit [nobr]

<p>
After successfully learning the rituals required to undo the spells,
<<yourrep $g.scout>> proceeded to
<<uadv $g.scout>> scour the forest for one of these moai fields.
<<if $gOutcome == 'success'>>
Upon finding one, they searched for a relatively unscathed statue.
After finding one,
<<else>>
Upon finding one, they found a magnificent specimen of a neko there,
with muscle covering every inch of <<their $g.statueleader>> statuesque body.
Your
<</if>>
slavers inspected the statue closer, and found the pole inserted right
up the statue's ass, just like the rumors said.
</p>

<p>
According to the information they received, the dildo is the key to undo the spell.
In order to break the spell, one must overwhelm the spell by making the dildo
far too wide to contain the spell. The easiest way is to insert another dildo into the
statue's already ravaged hole, or in some case, your slaver's dick -- effectively
double penetrating the statue.
</p>

<p>
<<Yourrep $g.cursebreaker1>>
<<if $g.cursebreaker1.isHasTrait('per_chaste')>>
reluctantly
<</if>>
volunteered for the task and used <<their $g.cursebreaker1>>
<<if $g.cursebreaker1.isHasTrait(setup.trait.dick_tiny)>>
  dick
<<else>>
  arms
<</if>>
to double penetrate the statue. 
Within seconds, the statue's outward ceramic shattered revealing
<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
the magnificent specimen of a neko,
<<else>>
the neko inside,
<</if>>
who immediately collapsed unconscious, but breathing.
Who knows how long such a neko had been living as a statue like this, but the experience
had drained both their hole's tightness and their mind, leaving them useful
for nothing but a broken, unresponsive sex toy.
Your slavers gathered the new slave as well as the valuables around to bring back to your fort.
</p>


:: QuestNekoStatueFailure [nobr]

<p>
Even though your slavers managed to
learn the rituals required to undo the spells, your
scout <<rep $g.scout>> scout|was not able to find any of the moai statue fields.
</p>



:: QuestNekoStatueDisaster [nobr]

<p>
Your slavers were too aggressive trying to learn how to undo the spell,
which drew the ire of one particularly sadistic elf.
She tricked your slavers, pretending to teach them how to undo the spell,
while in reality casting the petrification spell directly on your slavers.
Fortunately, the spell's power had been lost over time, and the partly
petrified dicks and breasts of your slavers will return to normal in time.
</p>
