:: Quest_catnapping [nobr]

<p>
There is always demand for neko slaves â€”- with cute ears and tails, and
occasionally cat-like eyes, they make adorable pets for many nobles in the
undercity of Lucgate.
</p>

<p>
According to the realm history, the neko originally evolved from cats.
A particular genetic trait they share to this very day with their feline companions is
their attraction to catnips,
and you have hatched a plan based on this.
Using a specialized slaver, you can try using a catnip to lure one of the neko
into the open fields.
Once they are out in the open, far away from civilization, it would
be child's play to have two other slavers kidnap the addled slave and bring them to their new
loving home.
</p>


:: Quest_catnappingCrit [nobr]

<p>
Your slavers had to travel to great length to find a catnip --- apparently the neko population
had driven catnip to almost extinction from the surrounding regions.
With a catnip in hand,
<<rep $g.catnipper>> <<uadv $g.catnipper>> went into a small neko tavern.
<<if $g.catnipper.isHasTrait('race_catkin')>>
  Despite being a little addled by the catnip <<themself $g.catnipper>>, the
  neko slaver <<rep $g.catnipper>>
<<else>>
  Your <<urace $g.catnipper>> slaver
<</if>>
managed to lure out one of the neko patron.
<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
  <<Rep $g.catnipper>> even somehow managed to convince the potential slave to bring along
  some of <<their $g.neko>> belongings.
<</if>>
</p>

<p>
  It seemed <<rep $g.catnipper>> had selected a particularly sensitive neko
  as <<they $g.neko>> walked to the clearing already in an almost trance-like state.
  Away from the village and civilization, <<rep $g.kidnapper1>> and <<utheirrel $g.kidnapper1 $g.kidnapper2>>
  made quick work subduing the addled neko.
  The neko will make a fine slave once you teach <<them $g.neko>> the proper behavior of a neko slave<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>,
  while <<their $g.neko>> now-useless belongings are pawned for a decent
  sum<</if>>.
</p>

<<if $g.catnipper.isHasTrait('race_catkin')>>
<p>
  The catnipper apparently also put <<rep $g.catnipper>> into a similar trance,
  and your other slavers ended up having to carry <<reps $g.catnipper>> unresponsive
  <<ubody $g.catnipper>> next to the slave <<them $g.neko>> back home.
  <<run setup.qc.TraumatizeRandom('catnipper', 2).apply($gQuest)>>
  <<run setup.qc.BoonizeRandom('catnipper', 8).apply($gQuest)>>
</p>
<</if>>


:: Quest_catnappingFailure [nobr]

<p>
Unfortunately, your slavers never found any unsuspecting neko victim to lure
using their hard-earned catnip. After spending a fruitless week they decided to give up
and head home.
</p>


:: Quest_catnappingDisaster [nobr]
<p>
The plan backfired as <<rep $g.catnipper>> somehow catnipper|was lured by a
group of unscrupulous neko, who proceeded to attempt to tame <<therace $g.catnipper>> and
made <<them $g.catnipper>> into their cumslut.
<<Yourrep $g.kidnapper1>> and <<rep $g.kidnapper2>> had to risk their lives
"kidnapping" <<rep $g.catnipper>> from the neko, before any permanent mental
changes were inflicted upon <<therace $g.catnipper>>.
</p>
