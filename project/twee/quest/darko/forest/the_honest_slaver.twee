:: Quest_the_honest_slaver [nobr]
<p>
The folks living in the <<lore region_forest>> often tell the tale of an honest
woodcutter, who accidentally dropped <<their $g.woodcutter>> axe to a river.
Since <<their $g.woodcutter>> axe was <<their $g.woodcutter>> only mean of
livelihood, <<they $g.woodcutter>> sat down and wept. Taking pity on <<them
$g.woodcutter>>, the spirit of the lake dived into the water and returned
with a golden axe. "Was this what you had lost?", <<they $g.lady>> asked, but
the woodcutter said it was not, and returned the same answer when a silver
axe was brought to the surface. Only when <<their $g.woodcutter>> own tool is
produced does <<they $g.woodcutter>> claim it. Impressed by <<their
$g.woodcutter>> honesty, the <<lady $g.lady>> of the river allowed <<them
$g.woodcutter>> to keep all three.
</p>

<p>
Hearing of this good fortune, your slavers came up with the idea of throwing
your own object into the river, and wailed for its return. Of course, the
<<lady $g.lady>> can probably sense the evilness in your slaver who came up
with the idea, so the better idea is to send a team of slaver â€” let the
object be dropped into the river by one of your slaver, and let your most
honorable slaver do the wailing.
It might work out, or it might just be a fairy tale...
</p>

<p>
<<Rep $g.schemer>> <<uadv $g.schemer>> bought a big wooden dildo in a nearby
village. Guided by <<rep $g.scout>>, your slavers arrived at the supposed
river. There, <<rep $g.schemer>> dropped the dildo into the river, and
together with <<rep $g.scout>> hid far away from the area, leaving <<rep
$g.honest>> to try and beg for the dildo's safe return all by <<themself
$g.honest>>,
being as
<<if $g.honest.isHasTrait('per_direct')>>
honest
<<elseif $g.honest.isHasTrait('per_humble')>>
humble
<<elseif $g.honest.isHasTrait('per_kind')>>
kind
<<elseif $g.honest.isHasTrait('per_honorable')>>
honorable
<<else>>
chaste
<</if>>
as <<they $g.honest>> could possibly feign while <<they $g.honest>> did so.
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
<p>
The <<lady $g.lady>> of the river obviously sensed the wickedness coming out
from <<theslaver $g.honest>>, what with such an indecent item being thrown into the
river. But upon seeing <<yourrep $g.honest>>, <<they $g.lady>> could not help but
be charmed by the aura of good emanating from <<them $g.honest>>. Instead, the
<<lady $g.lady>> invited <<them $g.honest>> to dive into the river together to
"reclaim the dildo", and so <<they $g.honest>> did. It was unknown what
happened under the riverbed, but when <<rep $g.honest>> returned, it was with
a renewed vigor and a massive golden phallus. Your slavers sold the golden
dildo for a high price before returning back home.
</p>

<p>
Your slavers could not help but notice that the dildo appears to have slight
dents and an unnatural smell, as if it was used before.
<<Rep $g.honest>> honest|was oddly quiet about it.
</p>

<<elseif $gOutcome == 'success'>>

<p>
The <<lady $g.lady>> of the river obviously sensed the wickedness coming out
from <<theslaver $g.honest>>, what with such an indecent item being thrown into the
river. But <<reps $g.honest>> goodness still tugged on <<their $g.lady>> heart,
and after deciding what was best, <<they $g.lady>> decided to unceremoniously
throw a silver dildo, accidentally hitting <<reps $g.honest>> head. Sensing
that it was all they were going to get, your slavers went back home after
selling the silver dildo for a decent sum. Your slavers never noticed how the
<<lady $g.lady>> lustfully eyed <<rep $g.honest>> on their way out
of the forest...
</p>

<p>
You probably should scold your slavers for bringing a dildo of all things to
the pure and innocent <<lady $g.lady>> of the river, but it worked out in
the end.
</p>

<<else>>

<p>
When the <<lady $g.lady>> appeared and
offered <<rep $g.honest>> a golden dildo, the <<man $g.honest>> <<uadv
$g.honest>> claimed it.
Sensing the deception and the wickedness from <<therace $g.honest>>,
the <<lady $g.lady>> of the river denied both that and the return of your own wooden dildo.
<<if $gOutcome == 'disaster'>>
Instead, <<they $g.lady>> bestowed a curse upon your slaver.
