<<set _describe = setup.dutytemplate.questbrothelmanager.describe()>>

<p>
Thanks to the recent expansion of <<attach _describe>>, the brothel's growth
has been unprecedented. More and more people are aware of your brothel now,
and many flock into your brothel to try the goods. But unfortunately, the
fame also attracts unwanted people in.
</p>

<p>
<<if _class > 0>>
Since you've chosen to make a rather classy brothel, a noble of the city has
deign it fit to impose a hefty tax upon your fine establishment. While a few
tax is fair, the amount imposed is almost bordering on extortion.
<<else>>
Since you've chosen to make a rather debauched brothel,
a gang of neko mafias has deign it fit to ask your brothel for "protection money".
While your establishment would be happy to pay a reasonable fee, the amount
they asked for was just too much, bordering on extortion.
<</if>>
This is
just unacceptable, and <<yourrep $g.owner>> owner|implore you to do something
while <<they $g.owner>> and the head whore <<name $g.head>> would try their
best to delay the payment as much as possible.
</p>

<p>
As much as you'd like to order your bouncers to put
<<if _class > 0>>
the noble in <<their $g.noble>> place, harming a noble is going to be an incredibly bad decision for you, so you'll
just have to convince the noble that it is in <<their $g.noble>> best interest to
keep the brothel up and running.
<<else>>
these criminals in their place, they are also
a rather significant part of your customer, and angering them would be an
incredibly bad decision for you.
You'll just have to convince these scums that it is in <<their $g.noble>> interest to
keep the brothel up and running.
<</if>>
A convincer should be sent to spearhead the negotiation, as well as an
imposing bodyguard to add to the negotiation. Finally, to demonstrate the
worth of your brothel, you should also send one of your slavers as a "whore",
together with a real whore from the brothel. Surely with their masterful
expertise over sex,
<<if _class > 0>>
they'll convince the noble that this brothel is "good for <<them $g.noble>>".
<<else>>
they'll overwhelm the criminal's primal instincts and convince <<them $g.noble>> that this brothel
has "<<their $g.noble>> best interest at heart".
<</if>>

<p>
As it happened,
<<if _class > 0>>
the noble
<<else>>
the mafia boss
<</if>>
was doing a surprise visit to your brothel to
collect the
<<if _class > 0>>
"tax",
<<else>>
"protection money",
<</if>>
by the time <<yourrep $g.convincer>> arrived. Using
<<their $g.convincer>> silver tongue, <<therace $g.convincer>> managed to
<<uadv $g.convincer>> convince <<them $g.noble>> to give your brothel a try first,
before collecting <<their $g.noble>> "well-deserved"
<<if _class > 0>>
tax.
<<else>>
protection money.
<</if>>
A full-on service
for an entire month, all courtesy of <<attach _describe>>.
</p>

<p>
Before the <<= _noble>>
was able to refuse, <<yourrep $g.whore>> as well as the head
whore <<name $g.head>> stripped down, before advancing slowly into
the <<= _noble>>.
Apparently having done <<their $g.head>> research, the head whore <<name
$g.head>> knew very well that the <<= _noble>>
<<if _sub == 'sub'>>
loves nothing more than to dominate other <<men $g.head>>, and <<therace
$g.head>> dropped into the floor while offering a whip into the noble.
<<else>>
harbors a secretly submissive tendencies, and <<therace $g.head>> sternly
ordered the <<= _noble>> to drop on <<their $g.noble>> knees.
<</if>>
<<Yourrep $g.convincer>> could see the <<= _noble>>
<<if $g.noble.isHasDick()>> was getting a hard-on, and a stiff prick was visibly tenting from <<their $g.noble>> pants.
<<else>>
was getting aroused, flushing all over.
<</if>>
Without saying a word, the trio went into one of the
<<if _facility == 'rooms'>>
luxurious private rooms, no doubt to enjoy some "private time" together.
<<else>>
sex dungeons, no doubt to enjoy some "private time" together.
<</if>>
</p>

<p>
Throughout the four weeks, <<yourrep $g.whore>> as well as the head whore <<name $g.head>>
serviced the <<= _noble>>, indulging in every bit of <<their $g.noble>>
<<if _sub == 'sub'>>
darkest fantasies.
<<else>>
secretly submissive tendencies.
<</if>>
Loud sounds of moaning could be heard every now and then, and they were
almost only seen outside of the room for basic necessities. In the end, the
<<= _noble>> changed <<their $g.noble>> mind completely, and decided to
<<if _class > 0>>
waive all taxes of your establishment for its "service for the people".
<<else>>
protect your establishment without collecting any pay, for the good of <<their $g.noble>>
people.
<</if>>
The head whore <<name $g.head>> had done a tremendous job this time,
and perhaps <<their $g.head>> talents are wasted working as a whore...
</p>

<p>
<<if _class > 0>>
As the noble went back to <<their $g.noble>> palace,
<<else>>
As the mafia boss went back to <<their $g.noble>> hideout,
<</if>>
<<they $g.noble>> did so
while leaving some of <<their $g.noble>> valuable clothings inside. <<Yourrep
$g.convincer>> brought them back to your fort for your perusal.

<<set _class = setup.dutytemplate.questbrothelmanager.class()>>

<p>
Unfortunately, <<yourrep $g.convincer>> convincer|was unable to convince the noble of the merits of your fine establishment.
<<if $gOutcome == 'disaster'>>
When your slavers tried to protest,
<<if _class > 0>>
the noble called upon one of <<their $g.noble>> hulking bodyguards
<<else>>
the mafia boss called upon one of <<their $g.noble>> hulking bruisers
<</if>>
to rough up one of your slavers, and <<yourrep $g.whore>> ended up injured.
<</if>>
In the end, your slavers were forced to pay the month's
<<if _class > 0>>
tax
<<else>>
protection money
<</if>>
for your brothel,
which they grudgingly paid. You'll have to try again if you want to solve
this problem for good.
