<p>
The manager of your brothel, <<yourrep $g.owner>>, owner|have
informed you that
a most noble visitor is planning a visit to <<attach _describe>>. The visitor
is no ordinary noble â€” in fact, <<they $g.target>> target|is a member of the
neko royalty, a title held by an extreme select few within <<lore
geo_mestia>>. The official reason for the visit is as follows: the royal
has heard of the many wonders provided by your brothel, especially the
<<if _attraction == 'gravity'>>
Magic Gravity Room,
<<else>>
Magic Bondage Room,
<</if>>
and would like to ensure that it meets all the required safety standard within the <<lore location_npc>>.
</p>

<p>
However, a tip from one of the brothel's worker gives a very different reason. The noble is apparently a secretly submissive slut, and
<<if _sub == 'dom'>>
having heard of the many dominant courtesans within your brothel,
<<else>>
having heard that your brothel's courtesans are also capable of domming,
<</if>>
<<they $g.target>> target|have decided that perhaps the brothel would be able to provide <<them $g.target>> with one of <<their $g.target>> darkest fantasies: being completely dominated by an evil dark wizard and their two evil hulking minions.
</p>

<p>
If you want to ensure that the royal is satisfied, you can try to send a group of slavers to help out with the client. A real dark wizard should do wonder, as well as two other slavers to act as the minions. With luck, the royal should pay very well for the outstanding service.

<p>
The royal spent lavishly on the compound, and bought your three slavers together with the head courtesan <<name $g.slave>> for a full month. Knowing full well of the royal's submissive tendencies, once they arrive at a secluded dungeon cell, <<yourrep $g.wizard>> <<uadv $g.wizard>> began the play. <<They $g.wizard>> used <<their $g.wizard>> real mastery over dark magic to conjure darkness, enveloping the area and blocking off the exit while <<yourrep $g.dom1>> and <<utheirrel $g.dom1 $g.dom2>> <<rep $g.dom2>> began their molestations over the royal. The royal tried to struggle, but judging from
<<if $g.target.isHasDick()>>erect dick<<else>>wet pussy<</if>>, your slavers knew all too well that it was an act, and the royal was having the time of <<their $g.target>> life. Not to be outdone by your slavers, your former slave <<name $g.slave>> without warning shoved <<their $g.slave>> <<udickorstrap $g.slave>> into the royal's gaping <<umouth $g.target>>. The sound of rough sex then continued over the night, and then the next few days, and so until finally a month had passed.
</p>

<p>
The royal appeared as a mess to your slavers, with <<their $g.target>> every hole filled with questionable bodily and not-so-bodily fluids. But the royal turned out to be a level-headed <<urace $g.target>>, and once the playtime was up, <<they $g.target>> got to <<their $g.target>> slightly wobbly feet, and resumed <<their $g.target>> professional-looking face. Completely satisfied with the service, <<they $g.target>> paid generously for your brothel's services<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>, as well as promising to put good words about your company.<</if>>
</p>

<p>
Surprisingly, a few days after the visit, you found the royal all by <<themself $g.target>> knocking literally on your office door.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, despite being secretly submissive, the royal maintained <<their $g.target>> professional mask throughout. When your slaver tried to assume dominance, the royal took it as a personal insult, and had all three of your slavers arrested for treachery. You've never heard back from the trio, but if you have a Rescuer, they might be able to locate your slavers back if they work very hard. <<if $gOutcome == 'disaster'>>Although it's unclear if your slavers would be able to return unchanged.<</if>>
