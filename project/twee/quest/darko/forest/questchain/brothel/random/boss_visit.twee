<p>
Your fine establishment, <<attach _describe>>, caters to a wide range of fetish.
<<if _sub == 'sub'>>
While most of the courtesans are submissive sluts, the establishment prides
itself in being able to cater to subs as well, although not very effective at
it.
<<elseif _sub == 'dom'>>
Customers can engage in a consensual dom-to-dom sex, or even fulfill their fantasies of being dominated by your masterful courtesans.
<<else>>
The many courtesans under your employ are comfortable in both topping and bottoming.
<</if>>
While it has attracted people with certain fetish, it also attracts people with relatively vanilla tastes.
</p>

<p>
One such people is apparently the leader of a criminal gang in the <<lore
location_npc>>.
The manager of your brothel, <<yourrep $g.owner>>, owner|have
informed you that
the leader of the criminal gang has decided to plan a visit into your brothel <<themself $g.target>>,
after hearing so much about your brothel's degeneracy. For such an
important client, it might be good to go the extra effort, and supply your
own experienced men for the occassion. The crime boss would no doubt expect
the three basic necessities of any brothel worth its salt: the security, the
entertainment, and most importantly the <<girl $g.head>>.

<p>
Your three slavers performed their job admirably satisfying the important client. <<Yourrep $g.guard>> stood guard over the place, making sure that no miscreant would dare to cause problems in the venue.
Meanwhile <<yourrep $g.entertainer>>
<<if $g.entertainer.isHasTrait('skill_entertain')>>
entertainer|is a masterful entertainer, and had no trouble whatsoever making sure the boss was always entertained.
<<else>>
entertainer|is a solid entertainer, and managed to make sure that the boss remained entertained at all times.
<</if>>
<<Yourrep $g.whore>> together with the head courtesan <<name $g.slave>> are assigned to a particular private suite that have been reserved by the boss, and they engaged in many lovemaking throughout the stay.
</p>


<p>
The boss was satisfied by the services rendered — not an easy task at all considering the quality <<they $g.target>> had expected — and paid generously for it.
<<if $gOutcome == 'success'>>
<<They $g.target>> promised to visit again sometime in the future, if your brothel is still operational by then.
<<else>>
In fact, <<they $g.target>> target|was so impressed that <<they $g.target>> got inspired to take a little break from the stressful duty of managing a criminal enterprise, and offered to join your company as a slaver as a sort of vacation. You can certainly make use of such a skilled slaver, but ultimately the decision is yours.
<</if>>

<p>
Unfortunately, your venue did not give a great impression on the boss. The boss felt <<their $g.target>> time was wasted, and demanded pay for the lost time. In the end,
<<if $gOutcome == 'disaster'>>
<<yourrep $g.guard>> and <<rep $g.whore>> were taken as "payments".
Better get your Rescuer to work if you want to see them ever again...
<<else>>
<<yourrep $g.whore>> whore|was taken as payment.
<<uneedrescue $g.whore>>.
