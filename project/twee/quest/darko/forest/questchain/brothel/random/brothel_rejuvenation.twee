<p>
It has been a number of years since the exterior of <<attach _describe>> was worked on. And age has started to show its marks — the brothel's decorations are already looking a little worn down, and its interior could use some rework.
<<if _class >= 20>>
The red carpet decorating the entrance is starting to show its seams here and there,
<<elseif _class <= -20>>
The bondage devices hanged in the entrance to your brothel is starting to get rusty here and there,
<<else>>
Some of the plants in the reception area has already withered,
<</if>>
<<if _attraction == 'gravity'>>
and the magical crystals powering the Magic Gravity Room are already starting to lose power.
<<else>>
and the various enchantments in the Magic Bondage Room are waning in strength.
<</if>>
The profit suffers as a result.
</p>

<p>
<<Yourrep $g.owner>>, as well as the
<<if _promotion == 'money'>>
business manager,
<<else>>
customer relations officer,
<</if>>
are unhappy about it to. They have drafted a grand plan to rejuvenate the place, rebuilding the palace from the grounds up and ensuring everything remains shiny and in top-notch working condition.
</p>

<p>
The only problem is that it would cost you a heavy <<money 200000>>, which will all come from your coffers. However, the cost will no doubt be recouped in the long term — at least if <<yourrep $g.owner>>'s calculations were to be believed! The renovation should make the brothel highly profitable for the next seven or eight years.

<p>
It took two months, but your three slavers had worked hard, and the brothel was rebuild from anew. Following <<yourrep $g.planner>>'s master plan, the builders <<rep $g.builder1>> and <<utheirrel $g.builder1 $g.builder2>> <<rep $g.builder2>> worked their asses hard, and finally the new brothel building was completed.
<<if _class >= 20>>
The entrance feels luxurious once again,
<<elseif _class <= -20>>
The smell of heavy bondage now permeates the entrance again,
<<else>>
The entrance induces an exotic feeling again,
<</if>>

<<if _attraction == 'gravity'>>
and the newly rebuilt Magic Gravity Room now properly hoist its customer mid-air once again.
<<else>>
and the various enchanted sex toys within the Magic Bondage Room now vibrate with great intensity once again.
<</if>>
Words of your brothel's grand renovation spreads too, and your brothel is bursting with customers once again.
<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
<<Yourrep $g.owner>> had the bright idea of letting customers enjoy the facilities for free for a day, which makes a lot neko as well as visiting elves like your company more.
<</if>>
</p>

<p>
With the renovation completed, the brothel's profit should soar again for the next seven or eight years.
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'failure'>>
<p>
Unfortunately, your builders got injured during the hefty construction process.
</p>
<</if>>

<<if $gOutcome == 'disaster'>>
<p>
Unfortunately, while working on the finishing touches of the brothel's spire, <<yourrep $g.builder1>> fell from the top of the building, sustaining heavy injuries.
</p>
<</if>>
