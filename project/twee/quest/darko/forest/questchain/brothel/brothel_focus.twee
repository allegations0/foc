<p>
Your brothel, which is known as <<attach _describe>>, is starting to
flourish. Customers can be seen perusing the available
<<if $g.head.isHasDick()>>stiff dicks,<<else>>wet pussies,<</if>>
<<if _class > 0>> in addition to the entertainment provided by the venue.
<<else>>
enhanced by the worker's basic sexual skills.
<</if>>
The slave bodyguard you assigned is
doing <<their $g.head>> duties properly too.
All in all, the operation seems to be going rather smoothly.
</p>

<p>
The manager of the place, that is <<yourrep $g.owner>>, owner|agree on it
too. But <<they $g.owner>> always think that the place could still be
better. Instead of settling with the current low-middle class customers,
perhaps the place can aim higher, with the goal of being luxurious enough fit
for a royal.
</p>

<p>
As a starting point, <<they $g.owner>> owner|suggest to enhance the worker's skill even further. Two weeks of dedicated classroom time should suffice. Since <<rep $g.owner>> will be plenty busy already with the daily operations of the brothel, you'll have to provide the teachers and the demonstrators from among your ranks, however.
</p>

<p>
<<Yourrep $g.teacher>> and <<their $g.teacher>> two demonstrators spent a good two weeks enhancing the skills of the <<men $g.head>> working in the brothel. <<Rep $g.helper1>> demonstrated many advanced sexual techniques on <<utheirrel $g.helper1 $g.helper2>> <<rep $g.helper2>>, and the two
enjoyed many sex in various awkward positions across the brothel.
<<if $g.helper1.isHasTrait('per_chaste') or $g.helper2.isHasTrait('per_chaste')>> (To the great embarrasment of the chaste slaver.)<</if>>
Your brothel's workers were quite impressed with the show, and they certainly learned a thing or ten from the experience and guidance.
</p>

<p>
Throughout the two weeks, the workers learned and practice the techniques on many various day-to-day utensils, furniture, and even vegetables straight from the fridge. By the tenth day, <<yourrep $g.teacher>> teacher|was confident that the students were ready to "graduate".
</p>

<p>
In the final day of the training,
the brothel launched a new package that showcased the new skills of these whores.
Many customers were interested, and the brothel raked in quite a bit of money as your brothel's <<women $g.head>>
<<if _class < 0>>
debauched themselves including one time where one of them used a decorative plant as a substitute for a lover.
<<else>>
strutted themselves and showed off their bodies sensuously, exposing the many customers to the pleasure of watching an expert strip show.
<</if>>
<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
Even your slavers themselves were "quite entertained" by the show, and enjoyed a good mood boost.
<</if>>
</p>

<p>
While the whores have considerable skills now, <<yourrep $g.owner>> owner|suggest that a focus be chosen for them to even specialize further. As the proprietor of the place, the decision falls to you and you alone.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, the workers of your brothel were simply too inexperienced to process the new techniques that your slavers had so masterfully demonstrated. In the end, <<yourrep $g.teacher>> judged that these students would need a couple more weeks of "on-the-job-practice" before another training can be attempted.
</p>

<p>
Your slavers were "overly enthusiastic" when they tried to demonstrate a wall sex to the <<men $g.head>> of the brothel. <<Yourrep $g.head>> fell head-first onto the floor, collapsing the "sex formation" they had precariously maintained, injuring all three of your slavers.
