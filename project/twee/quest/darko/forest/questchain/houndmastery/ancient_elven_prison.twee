<<set _u = setup.getAnySlaver()>>

<p>
The <<lore region_forest>> is full of ancient ruins, from bygone era when
ancient elves and tigerkins inhabited the land. However, thanks to the elven
enchantments which are still present until today, most of these ruins are hidden
from human eyes and has so far remains mostly untouched.
</p>

<p>
Normally, it would be impossible for anyone to breach these compounds. But
<<yourrep _u>> reminded you that currently you are being lent a certain
tigerkin pet with you blessed with a very keen nose. As the history books tell, some
tigerkins are capable of sniffing out these ancient enchanted ruins, and
discover them even without breaking the enchantment.
Perhaps this particular pet can be used for that...
</p>

<p>
You could try to send the pet together with a group of slavers on an
adventure to the forests. With the pet on a leash, with luck it'll sniff its
way to one of the ruins. From the history books, you have learned the
location of one of the ancient elven prisons situated within the forests.
There might be valuables and dangers lurking inside, so best prepare your
team!
</p>


:: Quest_ancient_elven_prisonCrit [nobr]

<p>
Fully geared with puppy gear, <<rep $g.pet>> pet|was led by your slavers to
scour the woods. While the first week looked fruitless, in the second week the
pup suddenly stopped mid-walk and began to sniff the surrounding
suspiciously. <<They $g.pet>> then suddenly begged for your slavers to go on
a certain direction, no doubt feeling something inhabiting the place.
</p>

<p>
Soon enough, your slavers can feel the air around them suddenly turned
ancient, and the open field before them morphed into an ancient building — no
doubt the ancient elven prison they had been looking for. It looked both
derelict and pristine, with ancient pots still unsmashed. But instead of
looking like a regular prison, the ancient elves seemed to use their
petrification magic to store their prisoners. Lines and lines of ancient
tigerkin statues filled the halls, no doubt prisoners of some bygone era forced
into a petrified state.
</p>

<p>
Many of the statues were placed behind magically barred barrier, which meant
that your slavers were unable to get these highly valuable statues. But <<rep
$g.adventurer2>> <<uadv $g.adventurer2>> stumbled into what seems to be the
interrogation room, and therein lied a single pristine tigerkin statue.
<<if $g.gender.isHasDick()>>
Like all other male tigerkin statues, his dick is permanently erect and
leaking what seems to be precum.
<<else>>
Like all the female tigerkin statues, her pussy is permanently wet and
leaking what seems to be girlcum.
<</if>>
Thanking their luck, your slavers decided to bring the statue as a valuable
loot back home, and <<yourrep $g.muscle>> heaved the heavy statue up to be carried
away.
<<if $g.muscle.isHasTrait('muscle_verystrong')>>
  <<Rep $g.muscle>> looked mildly fatigued by the end of the adventure,
  but that's still exceptional considering how heavy the statue must have weighted.
  <<Their $g.muscle>> <<ubody $g.muscle>> certainly did good work.
<<elseif $g.muscle.isHasTrait('muscle_strong')>>
  <<Rep $g.muscle>> looked mildly fatigued by the end of the adventure,
  but that's still exceptional considering how heavy the statue must have weighted.
  <<Their $g.muscle>> <<ubody $g.muscle>> certainly did good work.
<<else>>
  <<Rep $g.muscle>> muscle|was completely exhausted by the end of the adventure,
  <<therace $g.muscle>> not really build to lug such a heavy statue around.
  <<run setup.qc.Injury('muscle', 1).apply($gQuest)>>
<</if>>

</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
<p>
As luck would have it, <<rep $g.adventurer2>> accidentally uncovered a hidden
door when <<they $g.adventurer2>> <<uadv $g.adventurer2>> leaned on it for a
little break. Your slavers found valuables behind, which they pawned along the
way for a large sum of money.
</p>
<</if>>

<p>
Your pet never broke character throughout the adventure, and <<rep
$g.adventurer1>> rewarded the obedient puppy with a treat at the end of the
adventure. <<if $g.adventurer1.isHasDick()>> Fresh cream straight from the
eclair — which the puppy eagerly sucked dry.<<else>>
Fresh juice straight from the melons — which the puppy eagerly lapped up.
<</if>> Such was the happy daily life of the puppy in your company.
</p>

<p>
Pet aside, now you have to decide what to do with this tigerkin statue of yours...
</p>


:: Quest_ancient_elven_prisonFailure [nobr]

<p>
Unfortunately, the pet <<reps $g.pet>> nose was not as keen as your slavers
had thought. <<They $g.pet>> instead led your slavers into one of the ancient
elven traps, and <<rep $g.adventurer1>> fell victim to the trap, being
teleported to who knows where. Your other slavers were not completely
unharmed either, having stepped into arrow traps which grazed some of them.
In the end, your remaining slavers returned home with the bad news. All the
while <<rep $g.pet>> stared with puppy eyes towards you and your slavers, and
nobody had the heart to punish such a good little puppy.
</p>

<p>
At least you can always give the quest another attempt, perhaps with a different team this time.
</p>


:: Quest_ancient_elven_prisonDisaster [nobr]

<p>
Unfortunately, the pet <<reps $g.pet>> nose was not as keen as your slavers
thought. <<They $g.pet>> instead led all of the team into a big ancient
elven teleporting trap, which teleported all of them all around the place.
<<Rep $g.adventurer1>> adventurer1|was teleported to a faraway land, but a
safe one and should return to your company given some time. <<Rep
$g.adventurer2>> adventurer2|was not as lucky, and got teleported into
another slaver company, which you happenped to get in contact with. You can
rebuy <<them $g.adventurer2>> immediately. And nobody knew where <<rep
$g.muscle>> muscle|was teleported to...
All the while <<rep $g.pet>> pet|was conveniently teleported back to your
office, and stared with you in confusion about everything that have just unfolded.
</p>

<p>
At least you can always give the quest another attempt, perhaps with a different team this time.
