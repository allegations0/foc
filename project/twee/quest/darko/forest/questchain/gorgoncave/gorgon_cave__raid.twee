:: Quest_gorgon_cave__raid [nobr]

<<include 'Opportunity_gorgon_cave'>>

<p>You have chosen to try and raid the lair for riches.
</p>

:: GorgonCaveCommon2 [nobr]

<p>
Your slavers prepared as best as they could for the quest.
<<Yourrep $g.fighter1>> and <<rep $g.fighter1>> <<uadv $g.fighter1>>
practiced specialized techniques to slay tentacled guardians, while <<rep
$g.support>> <<uadv $g.support>>
prepared <<their $g.support>> best healing salves to support the team.
</p>


:: GorgonCaveCommon3 [nobr]

<p>
Once your slavers arrived at the caverns, they were immediately beset by the
two hulking tentacled guardians.
They appeared as an amalgamation of tentacles, vaguely resembling a demon, but tinted green.
They moved eerily before
suddenly stabbing out one of its tentacles into your slaver's directions, but
<<yourrep $g.fighter1>> fighter1|was ready and skillfully blocked the attack.
<<Rep $g.fighter2>> followed up by slashing right into the guardian, which easily
cut the tentacles leaving them a slithering mess on the floor.
But the fight was far from over -- <<rep $g.support>>
healed the wounds throughout the fight as best as <<they $g.support>> could.

<<set _fire = setup.selectUnit([$g.fighter1, $g.fighter2, $g.support], {trait: 'magic_fire'})>>
<<if _fire>>
Throughout the fight, <<rep _fire>> used <<their _fire>> fire magic to burn some away.
<</if>>

Eventually, with the combined mights of your slavers, they dispatched the guardians,
and then pressed depeer into the caverns.
</p>

<<if $g.slave.isMale()>>
    <<questimage "gorgon_cave_male.jpg">>
<<else>>
    <<questimage "gorgon_cave_female.jpg">>
<</if>>

<p>
The slavers were met with a most debauched of scenery.
Within the caves,
many slaves were displayed along the corridors, most were moaning softly as
all their cavities, be it mouth<<if $g.slave.isHasVagina()>>, anus, or vagina,<<else>> or anus<</if>>
were filled to uncomfortable fullness with slithering tentacles.
It seemed the wizard had a thing or two for tentacles sex --
various tentacle sex actions were enacted with various slaves posted in nearby rooms â€”
there was one where a slave is suspended in the air with nothing but
tentacles inside <<their $g.slave>> ass,
and another one where a caged slave begged as <<they $g.slave>> slave|was surrounded by what seemed
to be a sea of tentacles.
</p>


:: Quest_gorgon_cave__raidCrit [nobr]
<<include 'GorgonCaveCommon3'>>

<p>
Most of these slaves were already useless and far too gone from the relentless abuse, but your
slavers managed to find a relatively newly caught slave who had only been
ravaged bodily, but whose mind remained intact. They proceeded to "rescue" the slave from worse
fate and into your gentle care.
<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
They also found one of the wizard's prized belongings to take home before escaping the caverns.
<<else>>
They also grabbed whatever valuables they found lying nearby, before escaping from the caverns.
<</if>>
</p>

:: Quest_gorgon_cave__raidFailure [nobr]
<<include 'GorgonCaveCommon2'>>

<p>
Once your slavers arrived at the caverns, they were immediately beset by the
two hulking tentacled guardians.
They appeared as an amalgamation of tentacles, vaguely resembling a demon, but tinted green.
They moved eerily before
suddenly stabbing out one of its tentacles into your slaver's directions, which
caught your slavers off guard.
<<if $gOutcome == 'failure'>>
<<Yourrep $g.fighter1>> fighter1|was knocked down,
but before the guardian started to molest <<them $g.fighter1>>, <<rep
$g.fighter2>> came to the rescue.
<<Rep $g.fighter2>> managed to <<uadv $g.fighter2>> deflected all the attacks by <<themself $g.fighter2>>,
but got severely injured in the process before your slavers managed to escape from the clutches of these
tentacled guardians.
<<else>>
Having knocked <<rep $g.fighter1>> and the rest of the team to the ground,
the guardians proceeded to mindlessly molest your slaver's cavities, filling
their holes with their oversized tentacles over and over again until your
slavers were uselessly moaning in a combination of pain and pleasure.
After a brutal two hours of rough sodomy,
the guardians returned to their dormant states with the threats to the lair
completely neutralized.
