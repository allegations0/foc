<p>
You have chosen to help out by supplying a steady amount of milk, to be
extracted over these months. This means you'll have to supply three humanlike
cows for the plant's pleasure. There is little left to your
imagination of what horrors the plant will inflict upon these poor slaves, who
will be reduced into nothing but nutrient source for the plant for months to come,
and you best be prepared that
<<dangertext "whoever slave you decide to lend will unlikely to come back
mentally intact...">>

<p>
<<Yourrep $g.slaver>> had the presence of mind to gag the slaves securely
tying them next to the plant. Sensing food, the plant extended its tendrils,
before wrapping them securely, attaching an extractor vine to each of the
slaves' nipples. The slaves gagged and moaned as they felt their breasts emptied
over and over again, the painful feeling of forced lactation filling their minds
as their breasts were drained of every single drop of milk.
</p>

<p>
Being treated like a living nutrient source will no doubt drain these slaves
of all their sanity, were they to have any to begin with. Still, the plant
seemed to become healthier over the next few days, no doubt also thanks to <<yourrep
$g.slaver>> who somehow managed to secure a bottle of fresh cockmilk from
some other source that you had the presence of mind not to ask. <<if
$g.slaver.isHasDick()>>You have the sneaking suspicion that some of them even
come from <<theslaver $g.slaver>> <<themself $g.slaver>>... Still, it does not matter
much.<</if>> All that's left is to wait it out and hope the plant grows big
and healthy...
