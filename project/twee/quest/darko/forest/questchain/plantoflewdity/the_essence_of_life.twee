<<include "PlantOfLewdityEssenceOfLifeCommon">>

<p>
You have chosen to supply 10 bottles of <<rep setup.item.healing_potion>>.
You'd have to deliver them yourself once you gathered enough of them, but it
shouldn't take too long.
</p>

:: PlantOfLewdityEssenceOfLifeCommon [nobr]

<p>
After a few days, the Plant of Lewdity that <<yourrep $g.slaver>> had been
tending to sprouted.
But this is only the first step towards finishing <<reps $g.slaver>>
attempt to master <<their $g.slaver>> <<rep setup.trait.magic_earth_master>>,
but it's an important step nonetheless.
</p>

<p>
The Plant of Lewdity is rather special, and requires very specific
nourishment to grow strong and healthy. <<Rep $g.slaver>> must channel
<<their $g.slaver>> <<rep setup.trait.magic_earth>> magic every single day
into the plant, imbuing it with magic. But on top of that, there are extra
nourishment that the plant will require from time to time, including right
now.
</p>

<p>
Apparently, the plant requires so much energy that the nutrients inside the earth itself won't
be sufficient to support it. <<Rep $g.slaver>> estimated that some
essence of life would be beneficial as fertilizer for the plant, and since
<<they $g.slaver>> slaver|is going to be fully occupied taking care of the plant,
<<therace $g.slaver>> decided to ask for your help.
</p>

<p>
You handed over the potion to your slaver, who proceed to uncork one bottle
and generously spray it on the sapling. Before your eyes, you could see the
reddish liquid being absorbed very quickly by the roots, the ground drying almost
instantly.
<<if $g.you.isHasTrait('magic_earth_master')>>
Being a practitioner of <<rep setup.trait.magic_earth_master>> yourself, you
can definitely feel the plant's power growing from absorbing the liquid. A
strange feeling.
<<elseif $g.you.isHasTrait('magic_earth')>>
Being a beginner practitioner of <<rep setup.trait.magic_earth>>, you can
definitely sense that the plant was doing something with the liquid, but it was
quite vague.
<<else>>
Having no knowledge of earth magic, you could only guess whether it was actually
absorbed by the plant, or you were duped into buying a false healing potion...
<</if>>
</p>

<p>
All that's left is to wait for the plant to continue to grow, under the
supervision of <<yourrep $g.slaver>>...
</p>
