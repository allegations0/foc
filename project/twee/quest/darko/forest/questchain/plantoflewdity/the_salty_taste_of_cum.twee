<<include "PlantOfLewditySaltyAndSourTasteOfMilkCommon">>

<p>
You have chosen to help out by supplying a steady amount of cum, to be
extracted over these months. This means you'll have to supply three cum cows
for the plant's pleasure. There are little that is left to your imagination
of what horrors the plant will inflict upon these slaves, who will be reduced
into nothing but nutrient source for the plant for months, and you best be
prepared that
<<dangertext "whoever slave you decide to lend will unlikely to come back mentally intact...">>
</p>

:: PlantOfLewditySaltyAndSourTasteOfMilkCommon [nobr]

<p>
After 4 long months, the Plant of Lewdity has finally grown into a healthy
plant. Throughout the last few months, it greedily absorbs the nutrients from
the healing potions you've helped supply for it, and has grown into a sturdy
little plant.
</p>

<p>
Its caretaker, <<yourrep $g.slaver>>, is again asking you for help with the next
step. Apparently, the next step is to imbue the plant with essences that
represents saltiness and sourness â€” which apparently somehow translates to
milk and cum.
<<if $g.slaver.isHasTrait('skill_connected')>>
<<They $g.slaver>> slaver|is <<rep setup.trait.skill_connected>>, and would
have no issue whatsoever pulling strings to get these "ingredients",
<<else>>
<<They $g.slaver>> slaver|is quite resourceful, and would be able to obtain one of
the ingredients <<themself $g.slaver>>,
<</if>>
but would like to enlist your help to obtain the other.
</p>

<p>
<<Yourrep $g.slaver>> had the presence of mind to gag the slaves securely
before tying them next to the plant. Sensing food, the plant extended its tendrils,
before wrapping them securely in each of the slave's dicks and balls. The
slaves gagged and moaned as they felt their balls emptied over and over again,
experiencing the painful feeling of being forced to orgasm over, and over, and over
again, draining every single drop of cum from their overused balls...
</p>

<p>
Being treated like a living nutrient source will no doubt drain these slaves
of all their sanity as well, were they to have any to begin with.
Still, the plant seemed to become healthier over the next few days, no doubt also thanks to <<yourrep
$g.slaver>> who somehow managed to secure a bucket of fresh "milk" from some
other sources. All that's left is to wait it out and hope the plant grows big
and healthy...
</p>
