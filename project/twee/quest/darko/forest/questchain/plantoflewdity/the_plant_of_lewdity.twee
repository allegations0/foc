:: Quest_the_plant_of_lewdity [nobr]

<p>
People gifted with <<rep setup.trait.magic_earth_master>> are usually born with the
talent, and there are extremely few instances where those gifted with <<rep
setup.trait.magic_earth>> can upgrade their mastery.
However, if one is sufficiently insistent, it can be done with the assistance
of the so-called Plant of Lewdity. This incredibly rare plant is grown by
some sect of elves living in the <<lore region_forest>>, and these elves make
their living by selling seeds of these plants at an astronomical price.
</p>

<p>
Since you have a slaver under your employ gifted with <<rep
setup.trait.magic_earth>>, it might be worth the efforts and money to
purchase one of the seeds from these elves. However, on top of the expensive
price, there is also the matter of growing the plant to maturity, which will no
doubt takes a lot of time and efforts from your company. But should you wish to go
along with the idea, best send the prospective slaver together with a
biologist and a guard to ensure the purchase go as expected.
</p>


:: Quest_the_plant_of_lewdityCrit [nobr]

<p>
The elves live modestly in their encampments, and your slavers received
minimal hospitality from them.
But hospitality wasn't what your slavers
expected â€”
they were there for a sole reason: to get the seed to the Plant of Lewdity.
</p>

<p>
After your slavers showed the crate of coins they brought, one of the elves gave
the box containing the seed to your slavers. It looked like a regular seed to
<<rep $g.gardener>>, but
<<rep $g.biologist>> <<uadv $g.biologist>> convinced the team that it was the
real deal. After all, there was no mistaking that
<<if $gOutcome == 'crit' || $gOutcome == 'success'>>
faint scent of sourness, saltiness, and sweetness
<<elseif $gOutcome == 'failure'>>
faint scent of musk
<<else>>
faint scent of corruption
<</if>>
coming from the seed.
<<Rep $g.gardener>> could also sense a faint trace of power, which was
particularly attuned to <<their $g.gardener>> mastery over <<rep setup.trait.magic_earth>>.
<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
Your slavers were able to negotiate a very good price for the seed, only
spending half of the money they brought.
<</if>>
Satisfied, your slavers exchanged the goods before heading back home to your fort.
</p>

<p>
The next step would be to grow the plant to maturity. This is an arduous
task, and <<yourrep $g.gardener>> will be fully occupied until the plant
matures, being unable to do any other task whatsoever. The Seed of Lewdity is
planted on a patch of land designated as a makeshift garden within your fort.
Until the plant matures, <<they $g.gardener>> must continuously channel
<<their $g.gardener>> <<rep setup.trait.magic_earth>> over into the plant,
forcing growth onto it.
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'failure'>>
<p>
However, something incredibly wrong happened on the next day.
When <<rep $g.gardener>> channeled <<their $g.gardener>> magic onto the plant,
the plant suddenly grew incredibly fast, before engulfing <<therace
$g.gardener>> with its tentacle-like vines.
By the time you've arrived at the garden, the plant had already entirely
covered your slaver,
pistoning its vines in and out of <<their $g.gardener>> <<uanus $g.gardener>>.
You had no choice but to order the plant cut to save your slaver, whose holes were
no doubt gaped by the ordeal if they were not already gaped to begin with...
</p>
<<elseif $gOutcome == 'disaster'>>
<p>
However, something incredibly wrong happened on the second day. When <<rep
$g.gardener>> channeled <<their $g.gardener>> magic onto the plant, the plant
suddenly grew incredibly fast, before engulfing <<therace $g.gardener>> with
its tentacle-like vines. By the time you arrived at the makeshift garden,
neither the plant nor <<theslaver $g.gardener>> were anywhere to be seen...
<<uneedrescue $g.gardener>>
</p>
<<else>>
<</if>>
