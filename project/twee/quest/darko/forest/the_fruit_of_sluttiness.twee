:: Quest_the_fruit_of_sluttiness [nobr]

<p>
The <<lore region_forest>> houses dangers of many kind: wild beasts, tentacle
monsters, and even the occassional slaver company, but
among these, a particularly nasty threat is the so called Fruit of Sluttiness.
These fruit disguises itself as an ordinary edible fruit, almost indistinguishable
from other delicious fruit in the forests.
But a particularly sensitive individual can sense the strange, arousing
odors coming out of the fruit, earning it the name.
When eaten, this fruit bestows absolute sluttiness to its host,
instilling sex addiction that is impossible to cure by any normal means.
</p>

<p>
It occurs to you that it might be possible to use this fruit to your advantage.
You need a particularly sensitive slaver to locate these fruits, and collect some of them.
Then, you need to lure an unsuspecting elf into consuming the fruit.
Once gulped down, with the full extent of the fruit's power and some encouragement from your slaves,
no matter what the elf's previous life and preferences was,
their mind will be fully transformed into that of a natural sex slave.
The slave will then surely beg to be made into your obedient little slut.
</p>

<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
  <<set _plus = $g.plus>>
<<else>>
  <<set _plus = $g.slut>>
<</if>>

<p>
<<if $g.biologist.isHasTrait('per_attentive')>>
  Thanks to <<reps $g.biologist>> keen sense,
<<else>>
  Probably by pure luck,
<</if>>
your slavers were able to successfully harvest the correct fruits from the forests.
With the fruits sealed tight, it was just a matter of finding the right elf to enslave.
With both <<rep $g.whore1>> and <<utheirrel $g.whore1 $g.whore2>> <<rep $g.whore2>> exuding their combined
sexual charm,
an unsuspecting elf was seductively lured into eating the fruit offered by your slavers.
Only when <<they _plus>> was already a few bites in that
<<they _plus>> started to realize that something was very wrong.
<<if $gOutcome == 'crit'>>
But by then, it was already far too late.
In an attempt to minimize <<their _plus>> resistance,
<<rep $g.whore1>> and <<rep $g.whore2>> molested and manhandled
<<reps _plus>> <<= setup.Text.genital(_plus)>>,
eliciting needy moans until <<their _plus>> mind was fully transformed
from an ordinary hard-working elf into that of a natural sex slave.
Once <<rep _plus>> finished gorging on the fruit, <<they _plus>> was
practically begging for your slavers to enslave <<them _plus>> and more,
which your slavers happily obliged.
<<else>>
In a show of resistance, <<they _plus>> tried to vomit the flesh <<they _plus>>
had eaten, but <<rep $g.whore1>> and <<rep $g.whore2>> were prepared for this turn of event.
<<if !$g.whore1.isHasDick()>>Donning a strap-on, <</if>>
<<rep $g.whore1>> shoved <<their $g.whore1>>
<<if $g.whore1.isHasDick()>><<udick $g.whore1>><<else>>strap-on<</if>>
down the poor elf's throat until <<they _plus>> swallowed
the fruit<<if $g.whore1.isHasDick()>> together with <<their $g.whore1>> cum<</if>>.
The deed done, <<rep _plus>> became one mess of a slutty elf who did not resist at all
as your slavers tied and carried the slave back home.
<</if>>
</p>


:: Quest_the_fruit_of_sluttinessFailure [nobr]
<p>
Your slavers failed the mission simply because <<rep $g.biologist>> was
unable to find the Fruit of Sluttiness in the first place. Well, at least no damage is done â€”
it could have been so much worse. Perhaps they can try again sometime.
</p>


:: Quest_the_fruit_of_sluttinessDisaster [nobr]
<p>
<<Rep $g.biologist>> managed to find the fruits they were looking for, but was
sloppy in picking and storing them. The odors somehow permeated out of their
bags and after some time, <<rep $g.whore1>> and <<rep $g.whore2>> began to
feel much more aroused than they normally would. By the time <<rep $g.biologist>>
realized what was happening, it was already too late, and <<rep $g.biologist>>
had to quickly ditch the fruits and restored whatever mind left back to both <<rep
$g.whore1>> and <<rep $g.whore2>>.
