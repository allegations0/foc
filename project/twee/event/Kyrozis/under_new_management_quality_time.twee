<p>
At the end of this week, your slavers finally returned from their "vacation" with the cuddly nekos,
looking happier
than ever. <<Yourrep $g.guard1>> recounted all the events of the vacation to you,
regardless of whether you want to hear it or not.
</p>

<p>
According to <<them $g.guard1>> (and backed up by both <<rep $g.guard2>>
and <<rep $g.pimp>>), the three of them had the time of their lives during
the week they spent with the brothel's staff. They hiked along the uninhabited sections
of the <<lore region_forest>>, bathed in hot a spring, cooked various unusual
of food together, explored the <<lore location_npc>>, and drank while
partying around a campfire, sometimes even sharing hugs and headpats. (In all
honestly, who could resist patting a cute cat of any sort?

<<if $g.guard1.isHasTrait('per_playful')>>
<<set _play = $g.guard1>>
<<elseif $g.guard2.isHasTrait('per_playful')>>
<<set _play = $g.guard2>>
<<elseif $g.pimp.isHasTrait('per_playful')>>
<<set _play = $g.pimp>>
<<else>>
<<unset _play>>
<</if>>
<<if _play>>
  The playful slaver <<rep _play>> may have went a little overboard with the petting, but
  the nekos seem to like it...
<</if>>

<<if $g.guard1.isHasTrait('per_serious')>>
<<set _grump = $g.guard1>>
Even the usually grumpy <<rep $g.guard1>>
<<elseif $g.guard2.isHasTrait('per_serious')>>
<<set _grump = $g.guard2>>
<<elseif $g.pimp.isHasTrait('per_serious')>>
<<set _grump = $g.pimp>>
<<else>>
<<unset _grump>>
<</if>>
<<if _grump>>
  Even the usually grumpy <<rep _grump>> couldn't resist petting a neko's head, or two, or three...
<</if>>
)
Just by looking
at them, you can tell they had a great time, and their morale is at an all-time high.
They will surely perform better on their duties for some time.
</p>

<p>
Soon after, you heard that the brothel was back to business, this time fully
owned by its workers. The brothel became one of the best brothels in the
area, and the workers paid your company back not in money, but by putting in
good words about your company's deeds and the time they had with your
slavers.
</p>
