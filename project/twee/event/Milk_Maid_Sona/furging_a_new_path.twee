<p>
<<Yourrep $g.slave>>'s mind has been restored, thanks to the recent treatment you have arranged for <<therace $g.slave>>.
You have done exactly as asked by the mysterious person behind a letter you received some time ago.
And new reports from your contacts in the <<lore region_forest>> reveal that this same person has apparently fulfilled their
part of the deal. As promised, multiple groups of neko see <<rep $company.player>>
as an ally. An ally for what, you aren't sure, but you don't look at a giftâ€¦
neko, in the fang, you guess? While you try to untangle the mind puzzle you
brought upon yourself, you notice another envelope just like the one before
slipped precariously between the other reports detailing multiple slimes
sightings in the vicinity of the <<lore region_city>>.
</p>

<<else>>

<p>
As soon as you sit in your office to relax, you notice an awfully familiar
letter on top of you desk.
It appears the old neko got his whiskers back in your business and had found out of the success
of your treatment for <<rep $g.slave>>.
Time to see what the neko writes to you this time.
</p>
