<<set _v = setup.getAnySlaver([_u])>>

<p>
  You enter your office to do your work. As is usual by now,
  something inordinary happened, and <<yourrep _u>> barges into your office, bearing bad news.
  Apparently, <<they _u>> notices that some slaves had gone missing when <<they _u>>
  went into the Dungeons
  <<if _u.isHasTrait('per_kind')>>
  to care for <<their _u>> favorite slave.
  <<else>>
  to have some "fun".
  <</if>>
</p>

<p>
  Going into the cells yourself, you notice there is a large hole in their cells.
  The tunnel seems to lead all the way from the dungeons to outside of the fort, and to their freedom.
  <<if _u.isHasTrait('per_smart')>>
  Thankfully, the smart slaver <<rep _u>> had already sent another slaver <<rep _v>> to scout ahead,
  looking for any trail the slaves may had left behind.
  <<else>>
  You quickly ordered
  another slaver, <<rep _v>>, to scout outside,
  looking for any trail the slaves may had left behind.
  <<else>>
  One of the escaped slaves seems to have hurt themselves, and there are visible trails that may
  lead to <<them $g.escapeone>>.
  There are no trace of the other one, however.
  <<uneedrescue $g.escapeetwo>>.
</p>

<p>
  When you are back at the comfort of your office, you start to wonder.
  How is it possible that the slaves managed to dig such a large tunnel outside, seemingly without
  any of you or your slavers noticing?
  Perhaps this is the work of one of the companies you may have angered recently,
  one particularly skilled in digging tunnels...
