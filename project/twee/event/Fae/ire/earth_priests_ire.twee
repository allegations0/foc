<p>
  Your hip is shaking rather wildly today.
  And no, it's not because you have too much energy today: your coffee mug is shaking too on the table.
  Apparently, an earthquake has just hit your fort, and you're guessing it is anything but normal.
  Looking across your fort, your suspicion is confirmed:
  large swathes of vines, as well as large pillars of earth are spawning from the earth,
  destroying parts of your fort's exterior.
</p>

<p>
  Thankfully, it did not last long.
  After a few more minutes, the vines and the pillars of earth cease to move,
  left around at your fort and blocking the paths.
  The fort structures look undamaged thankfully, but someone will have to work and remove all the
  debris around.
  Two of your slavers, <<pep $g.tiredone>> and <<pep $g.tiredtwo>> would (forcefully) be
  volunteered to clean the vines and the rubbles.
  They will work overtime as you mull just what in the earth had just happened... perhaps you angered
  something within the earth itself?
</p>
