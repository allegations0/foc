<<include 'Event_TigerBankRepoCommon'>>

<p>
The current sale offer is a bit different than usual.
The bank is offering you a brand new slave, apparently being the debtor <<themself $g.debtor>>.
<<Their $g.debtor>> debt has increased so much to the point that even after the many repo-men and women repossessed all <<their $g.debtor>> belongings, it was still not enough. <<They $g.debtor>> eventually put a slave collar on the poor <<urace $g.debtor>>'s neck, before eventually offering the new slave to you.
