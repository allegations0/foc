<<include 'Event_TigerBankRepoCommon'>>

<p>
The current sale offer by the bank was taken from a dormitory-house - apparently the people renting the establishment don't know their asses from their elbows in money-management. A few too many parties and frivolous purchases sent an asset reclamation officer to their door, soon leaving with one of those recent purchases - a
<<if $g.maid.isFemale()>>
pretty female
<<else>>
handsome male
<</if>>
slave who doubled as both a housekeeper and fuckhole for the whole bunch of horny tenants. <<They $g.maid>>'s cute and apparently well-trained, if a bit exhausted right now after numerous gang-bangs <<their $g.maid>> former owners put <<them $g.maid>> through.
</p>

<p>
Should you wish to purchase the slave, <<they $g.maid>> maid|have been delivered to your
<<rep setup.buildingtemplate.slavepens>> for your inspection.
When you inspect <<them $g.maid>> there, <<they $g.maid>> lowers <<their $g.maid>> head
obediently and asks, "<<Master $unit.player>>, what will my new tasks in your
household be? Shall I just clean or will there be... other things for me to
do?" The eager tremble in <<their $g.maid>> voice tells you that <<they $g.maid>>'s more than a little
aroused by the thought of being used, so you tell <<them $g.maid>> it'll all depend on if
<<they $g.maid>>'s a good slave...

<p>
The <<rep $company.bank>> is a fair financial establishment. They would offer their customer a safe place to store their valuables, as well as providing loans to those that needs them. But like everywhere else, there are winners and losers of the ever-changing market, and when someone falls upon hard times and fail to pay their loan, the many repo-men and repo-women of the bank start their work. Grim-faced and unmoved by sympathy, they go in to seize the debtor's assets to pay off their debts - which does at times include some quite interesting pieces of merchandise, like a nice slave or two. They would then offer to offload these merchandise quickly for a cheaper fee to their allies, which apparently include your company.
