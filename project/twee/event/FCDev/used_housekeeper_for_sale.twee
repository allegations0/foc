<p>
The current sale offer by the bank was taken from a business<<man $g.man>>'s house - one of the relatively higher income occupation in <<lore continent_main>>. <<They $g.man>>'s recently had fortune turn from <<them $g.man>> due to some unfortunate occurrences outside. The agent selling the slave doesn't say exactly which - some natural catastrophe, raiders, competing business or whatnot - one thing is for sure though, <<they $g.man>>'s in a financial pinch right now. All of which meant that <<their $g.man>> slave housekeeper was fair game to be taken and is now awaiting re-sale. As <<their $g.slave>> <<master $g.man>> never had any sexual interest in the slave, the <<man $g.slave>> is actually virgin-tight and used to the relatively cushy life of just watching the mansion. The fact that all of that ended from one day to the next has made <<them $g.slave>> quite afraid for <<their $g.slave>> future...

<<they $g.slave>> lowers <<their $g.slave>> head obediently and asks, "<<Master $unit.player>>, I - umm... what will be required of me? I'm really good with housework and... and I can sing. Also, I've -" The fearful tremble in <<their $g.slave>> voice tells you that <<they $g.slave>>'s more than a little afraid of what you might have planned for <<them $g.slave>>. Waving off the slave's frightened babbling, you tell <<them $g.slave>> that you'll decide what to do with <<them $g.slave>> should you decide to purchase <<them $g.slave>>.
