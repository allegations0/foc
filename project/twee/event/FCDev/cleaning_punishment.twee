<p>
<<Yourrep $g.slave>> clearly isn't working as hard as <<they $g.slaver>> should.
And this does not escape
the
<<if $g.slaver.isHasTrait('per_attentive')>>
attentive
<</if>>
eyes of <<yourrep $g.slaver>>, who once worked <<themself $g.slaver>> as a house-servant.
In fact, right now <<rep $g.slaver>> has <<them $g.slaver>> bent over with <<their $g.slaver>> buttocks bare, and is administering a punishing spanking.
<<Reps $g.slave>> <<uskin $g.slave>> is starting to show the force of the beating, and <<they $g.slave>> slave|is begging desperately for mercy.
</p>

<p>
<<name $g.slaver>>, meanwhile, is obviously enjoying torturing the poor servant for <<their $g.slaver>> failings. <<They $g.slaver>>'s
<<if $g.slaver.isHasDick()>>jacking off furiously
<<else>>rubbing <<their $g.slaver>> sopping pussy<</if>> with <<their $g.slaver>> other <<uhand $g.slaver>>,
getting close to orgasm as the servant begs and moans.
</p>

<<choose>>

<<opt "Fuck <<reps $g.slave>> mouth as <<rep $g.slaver>> beats <<them $g.slaver>>">>

<p>
You ask <<yourrep $g.slaver>> to continue the spanking.
<<Rep $g.slave>> has one anguished second to realize what's happening before you
<<ustrippantsand $unit.player>>
shove yourself <<if (!$unit.player.isHasDick())>>against <<their $g.slaver>> <<umouth $g.slave>><<else>>down <<their $g.slaver>> throat<</if>>. <<They $g.slaver>> gags reflexively, jerking back, only to jerk forward again in automatic pain avoidance when <<name $g.slaver>> hits <<their $g.slaver>> already-sore buttocks yet again. <<They $g.slaver>>'s broken enough to understand that <<they $g.slaver>> needs to relax and let <<themself $g.slaver>> be abused, but <<their $g.slaver>> <<ubody $g.slave>>'s reflexive responses deny <<them $g.slaver>> the relief that might give.
<<if $g.slave.isHasTrait('per_cruel')>>
The sadistic <<urace $g.slave>>
comes twice before you do, a deliciously cruel expression on <<their $g.slaver>> face.
<<else>>
You eventually
<<if $unit.player.isHasDick()>>
climaxes, sending torrent of cum straight down the slave's throat.
<<else>>
climaxes with the slave's <<umouth $g.slave>> still deep within your pussy.
<</if>>
<</if>>
Your abuse combined with the punishing slaps ensures that <<rep $g.slave>> learns <<their $g.slave>> lessons, promising to be more diligent next time.
</p>

<<run setup.qc.FriendshipWithYou('slaver', 150).apply($gQuest)>>
<<run setup.qc.FriendshipWithYou('slave', -150).apply($gQuest)>>

<<opt "Show mercy">>

<p>
The slave's continued begging and sobbing tugs at your heart, and you finally give in. You gently ask <<yourrep $g.slaver>> to cease the punishment, and the
<<if $g.slaver.isHasTrait('per_cruel')>>
cruel
<</if>>
slaver grudgingly let the slave go.
While the slave certainly appreciate your timely intervention, the slaver
most certainly do not, and you the two of you grow somewhat more distant as a result.
