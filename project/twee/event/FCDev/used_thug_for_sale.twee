<<include 'Event_TigerBankRepoCommon'>>

<p>
Crime are rather rampant in <<lore continent_main>>, and thug gangs are numerous across the continent.
The <<rep $company.bank>> is not picky about their customer as long as the money is good, and occasionally these gangs would loan a bag of coins or two for urgent business.
And occasionally, some gang would collapse just right when their debts are due, and their leader would be taken by the repo-men when nothing else of value was found.
</p>

<p>
The current sale offer by the bank was one such case â€”
in fact, you can see from your windows two of the repo-men carrying an unconscious form of a <<man $g.thug>>, who you easily recognize as a hardened criminal judging from their
<<if $g.thug.isMale()>>
broad shoulders, square jaws,
<</if>>
very well-muscled build and intimidating face.
The bank agent tells you that <<they $g.thug>> was a recently overthrown gangster boss in the
<<rep $g.thug.getHomeCompany()>>.
It might be fun to turn the once
<<if $g.thug.isMale()>>
macho <<man $g.thug>>
<<else>>
powerful <<man $g.thug>>
<</if>>
into a proper brainless slut, or you could turn <<them $g.thug>> into a gladiator too. Either way, you are sure to have fun with <<them $g.thug>>, should you decide to purchase <<them $g.thug>>.
