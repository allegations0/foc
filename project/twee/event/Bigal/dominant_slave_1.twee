<</if>>

<p>
As you approach your bedchamber to get some rest from your work, you hear your dominant slaves' voice coming from your chambers followed by a groan of bliss, indicating that <<they $g.slave>>'s been having fun without you. As you come around the corner and lean of the door frame you see that you have guessed correctly.
</p>

<p>

<<name $g.slave>> is standing over your little sub who has been forced to be on all fours

<<if _o.isHasTrait('training_pet_master') || _o.isHasTrait('training_pet_advanced')>>

like the good little pet <<they _o>> is

<<else>> like a pet

<</if>>

with a collar and leash attached to <<their _o>> <<uneck _o>>.
<<name $g.slave>> appears to be taking <<their $g.slave>> dominance training quite literally as they are currently training <<name _o>> to walk underneath their <<ulegs $g.slave>>. <<name $g.slave>> walks forward every few seconds and waits for <<name _o>> to stop, before crouching down on <<name _o>>, giving <<them _o>> a quick head massage as <<name $g.slave>> lowers their head down to <<their _o>> ear and whispers in the commanding tone you have taught <<name $g.slave>> so well: "You're being such a good little pet. You are going to make our <<Master $unit.player>> so happy when <<they $unit.player>> return."

At this point, <<name $g.slave>> walks around to face the door and looks up from <<name _o>>'s staring eyes to find you watching them both. With a sudden change in <<their $g.slave>> body language that indicates surprise, <<name $g.slave>> walks forward a little and locks <<their $g.slave>> legs around <<name _o>>'s head, forcing <<them _o>> to look at their <<Master $unit.player>>. Looking down at <<reps $g.slave>> head squished between two thighs causes you become somewhat aroused, and you start to get <<wet $unit.player>>.

</p>

<p>
You finally decide this is the time to enter the room and walk straight up to <<name $g.slave>> getting within a few inches of <<their $g.slave>> face and stare into <<their $g.slave>> eyes for a few moments. As <<name $g.slave>> becomes increasingly nervous, you break the battle of will and lean back a bit, "Good <<girl $g.slave>>, it's nice watching you two learn your places" as you give <<name $g.slave>>'s face a gentle stroke. You crouch down and give <<name _o>> a head scratch and then turn around and go over to your <<uslaverbed $unit.player>> and begin to strip. As you lie down with your <<ubreasts $unit.player>><<if $unit.player.isHasDick()>>, <<udick $unit.player>> and <<uballs $unit.player>>
<</if>>
on full display, you wave your <<uhand $unit.player>> at them both and instruct them to continue.
</p>

<p>
Regaining some composure, <<name $g.slave>> releases <<name _o>> from <<their $g.slave>> legs,

<<if !$g.slave.isHasDick()>> "stay" she commands and walks over to your toy collection to retrieve a large strapon then walks over

<<else>> takes a step back

<</if>>

and kneels down behind <<their $g.slave>> submissive pet. As <<they $g.slave>> does <<they $g.slave>> begins groping <<their _o>> butt while gentle probing <<their _o>> anus for a solid minute until <<reps _o>> <<uarms _o>> begin to shake. Just before <<their _o>> arms give out, <<name $g.slave>> reaches forward and roughly grabs <<their _o>>
hair
to keep <<their _o>>
<<uface _o>>
from falling into the ground. "Oh no you don't pet." <<they $g.slave>> says as <<they $g.slave>> pulls <<name _o>>'s hair back making <<their _o>> ass squeeze <<their $g.slave>> <<udickorstrap $g.slave>> between <<their _o>> cheeks. "You don't want to give in before you receive your reward, do you?" <<name $g.slave>> explains, causing <<name _o>> to make a slutty smile as <<they _o>> starts grinding <<their _o>> ass against <<them $g.slave>> accompanied with a quick bark.

<<set _o = setup.getAnySlaver()>>
<</if>>

<p>
Seemingly content on just watching your slaves, you lie back and enjoy the evening festivities as <<name $g.slave>> finally lets <<their $g.slave>> <<udickorstrap $g.slave>> slide into <<name _o>>'s <<uhole _o>>, causing <<them _o>> to groan happily and shudder. <<name $g.slave>> eventually lets go of <<name _o>>'s hair, allowing <<them _o>> to sink down to the floor and stick out <<their _o>> ass even more. "If you want this <<udickorstrap $g.slave>> <<name _o>>, you have to earn it", <<name $g.slave>> teases as <<they $g.slave>> picks up <<name _o>>'s leash again, making the collar tight against <<their _o>> neck, reminding <<them _o>> that <<their _o>> place is at the end of a leash, pleasing <<their _o>> <<Master $g.slave>>. <<Rep _o>> obediently reaches back and pulls apart <<their _o>> butt cheeks to reveal <<their _o>>
<<if _o.isHasVagina()>>
<<uvagina _o>> and
<</if>>
<<uanus _o>> for <<their _o>> <<Master $g.slave>> as <<they _o>> started humping <<name $g.slave>>'s <<udickorstrap $g.slave>>. "Good <<girl _o>>!"
</p>

<p>
With the constant action between your two slaves, it doesn't take long for <<name $g.slave>> and <<name _o>> to both almost reach their orgasms. "Ah ah ah, not yet pet. You don't get to
<<if _o.isHasDick()>>
cum
<<else>>
climax
<</if>>
unless you make me first. You won't want that would you." <<name $g.slave>> says as <<they $g.slave>> holds <<name _o>> firmly against <<them $g.slave>> so she couldn't hump anymore. <<name _o>> looks back with pure lust in <<their _o>> eyes, clearly begging for release "<<Master $g.slave>> please, am I not a good pet?". At that moment <<name $g.slave>> pulled on <<their _o>> collar again, pulling <<name _o>> up against <<their $g.slave>> <<ubreasts $g.slave>> and proceeds to start groping <<reps _o>> <<ubreasts _o>> and pinching <<their _o>> nipples. As soon as <<name _o>> started gasping again, <<name $g.slave>> thrusts forward, pushing them both on the ground as <<they $g.slave>> whispers in <<reps _o>> ears "I know you are.
<<if _o.isHasDick()>>
Cum
<<else>>
Climax
<</if>>
for me".
</p>

<p>
You eventually fell asleep to the quiet moans of your little puppy and the occasionally "Shh, don't wake <<Master $unit.player>>" coming from the other, more dominant slave.
</p>

<<opt "Help <<them $g.slave>> train their pet">>

<<set _o = $g.slave.getBedchamberOtherSlave()>>

<<if !_o>>
/* Should not happen, but nice for testing: */
<<set _o = setup.getAnySlaver()>>
<</if>>

<p>
Letting <<name $g.slave>> to continue to <<woman $g.slave>>handle <<name _o>>, <<name $g.slave>> finally lets <<their $g.slave>> <<udickorstrap $g.slave>> slide into <<name _o>>'s <<uhole _o>>, causing <<them _o>> to groan happily and shudder. You take this as your time to slide off your <<uslaverbed $unit.player>> and walk over to <<name _o>>. Crouching down in front of <<name _o>>, you spread your <<ulegs $unit.player>> seductively to reveal your

<<if $unit.player.isHasDick()>>

<<udick $unit.player>> and <<uballs $unit.player>> hanging tantalizingly

<<else>>

<<uvagina $unit.player>>

<</if>>

just slightly out of reach from <<reps _o>> <<umouth $unit.player>>.
</p>

<p>
Reaching out with both <<uhands $unit.player>>, you begin scratching your pet's head, eliciting a moan of satisfaction from <<them _o>>, before saying "<<name $g.slave>>, we should teach <<name _o>> some new tricks, and only if <<they _o>> does well with the trick can we both reward <<them _o>>."
</p>

<<opt "Let <<name $g.slave>> train two pets">>

<p>
Slowly getting up, you walk over to a drawer that you keep locked from your other slavers for a very important reason. <<name $g.slave>> and <<name _o>> both stop and watch you open the drawer and pull out a jeweled collar that you have been keeping for a special occasion. You walk over to <<name $g.slave>> and <<name _o>> and kneel down beside them both, before giving the collar to <<name $g.slave>>.
</p>

<p>
<<name $g.slave>> cautiously takes the collar in <<their $g.slave>> <<uhand $g.slave>> and looks back towards you puzzled. "You've been a good slave <<name $g.slave>> for quite some time and I think it's time I fully reward your loyalty towards your <<Master $unit.player>>." You lean over
<<reps _o>> back and kiss <<name $g.slave>>, to <<their $g.slave>> surprise, for several seconds before pulling back, "I have but one condition before we start. This stays between the three of us". <<name $g.slave>> does a quick bow of <<their $g.slave>> head, the surprise not having quite sunk in yet, while you feel <<name _o>> grab ahold of your thigh and rubs <<their _o>> head against it like a good cuddly cat. Guiding <<reps $g.slave>> <<uhands $g.slave>> with the collar still in them around your neck, you feel <<they $g.slave>> finally understand and finishes fastening the collar around your neck. With the collar fastened you get down on all fours next to <<name _o>> and nustle your head against <<theirs _o>> while presenting your butt to <<name $g.slave>>, just another pet for tonight's only <<Master $g.slave>>.
</p>

<p>
With two pets to train, <<name $g.slave>> has <<their $g.slave>> work cut out for them for the rest of the evening as <<they $g.slave>> routinely made each one of <<their $g.slave>> pets service <<their $g.slave>> <<udickorstrap $g.slave>> while the other tended to <<their $g.slave>> <<uhole $g.slave>>. The night ends after several hours of depravity with all three occupants lying exhausted on <<reps $unit.player>> <<uslaverbed $unit.player>>, <<reps $g.slave>> <<udickorstrap $g.slave>> still lodged deep inside <<reps $unit.player>> <<uhole $unit.player>>.
