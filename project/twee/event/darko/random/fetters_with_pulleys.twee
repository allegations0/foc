:: Event_fetters_with_pulleys [nobr]
<p>
<<Yourrep $g.slaver>> is quite the crafty <<urace $g.slaver>>. Ever since <<they $g.slaver>> joined your company years ago, <<they $g.slaver>> slaver|have been using <<their $g.slaver>> experience as an ex-inventor to craft various bondage devices.
<<if $g.slaver.isHasTrait('per_kind')>>
Being the kind slaver that <<they $g.slaver>> contradictory slaver|is, <<they $g.slaver>> slaver|do not use them <<themself $g.slaver>>, but mostly to fulfill a request or two from <<their $g.slaver>> friends.
<<elseif $g.slaver.isHasTrait('per_cruel')>>
<<They $g.slaver>> particularly delights in crafting the most painful-looking devices, and hearing the slaves scream in pain is fun for the cruel slaver.
<<else>>
<<They $g.slaver>> crafts most of the bondage tools <<they $g.slaver>> needs to use on the slaves, sometimes with a personal flair to spice up slave trainings.
<</if>>
<<if $g.slaver.isHasTrait('skill_creative')>>
<<Their $g.slaver>> creativity also means that these devices tend to be inventive, with a few nudges here and there that looks innocuous, but would often pleasurize the slave in inopportune times.
<</if>>
</p>

<<if $g.you.isHasTrait('bg_engineer')>>

<p>
Engineering is a shared interest for you too. After all, you consider yourself an engineer as well.
In fact, you've been helping <<theslaver $g.slaver>> with some unknown project in the recent days,
something <<they $g.slaver>> kept a secret even from you.
There are some chains involved, some wood here and there, but it was quite unclear what exactly
<<they $g.slaver>> slaver|was making.
And after a few weeks, only when the devices are ready that you understand what it is:
a set of pulleys and rope to be attached to a ceiling, and to be used on a slave for some fun bondage times.
And thanks to your help, <<they $g.slaver>> produced quite a number of them too.
<<They $g.slaver>> slaver|is giving all of them to you... not for free though.
</p>

<<else>>

<p>
Recently, <<theslaver $g.slaver>> slaver|have been spending quite a lot of time in the fort's <<rep setup.buildingtemplate.forge>>, together with the resident blacksmith. And you finally know why today — the slaver comes to your office bringing a unique contraption: a set of pulleys and sturdy rope ending with a pair of fetters.
The contraption could be installed in some bedchamber, and can be used to hang a slave or two from the ceiling for some fun bondage nights. Alternative, you can always find a buyer that is willing to purchase such a unique contraption for their perverted uses.
</p>

<</if>>

<p>
<<if $g.slaver.isHasTrait('per_lavish')>>
Surprisingly, the slaver only asks for a pittance pay in return, just <<money 500>> to barely cover the costs — fitting, considering how generous the slaver is. You're not going to complain either way!
<<elseif $g.slaver.isHasTrait('per_frugal')>>
But of course, there is a matter of costs involved in making the contraption, and according to your slaver, it amounts to a whopping <<money 4000>>. You have your doubts, especially considering how greedy the slaver is, but decide that it's worth the price for such a unique piece of furniture.
<<else>>
All your slaver asks for is some money to cover the materials — a reasonable sum of <<money 2000>>, which you <<uadv $unit.player>> pay.
<</if>>
</p>

<p>
Now that you have your <<uhands $unit.player>> on the <<rep setup.item.f_punishment_good_slaver>>,
<<if $inventory.isHasItem('sexmanual_upsidedown')>>
you might want to reconsult your <<rep setup.item.sexmanual_upsidedown>> to see if there's any interesting use you can get out of this furniture...
<<else>>
you can't help but wonder if there's something kinky you could do with it...
<</if>>
</p>
