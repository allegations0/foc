:: Event_combat_training [nobr]
<p>
Even after joining your company as a slaver, <<yourrep $g.slaver>> still have some of their old habits from <<their $g.slaver>> days as a
<<if $g.slaver.isHasTrait('bg_knight')>>
knight.
<<elseif $g.slaver.isHasTrait('bg_mercenary')>>
mercenary.
<<else>>
soldier.
<</if>>
One of them is the daily combat practice that <<they $g.slaver>> almost religiously do on the <<rep setup.buildingtemplate.traininggrounds>>.
<<if $g.slaver.isHasTrait('bg_knight')>>
The daily combat practice is necessary to allow <<them $g.slaver>> to wear <<their $g.slaver>> knight armor in the past, and <<they $g.slaver>> slaver|is unable to break out of the habit of practicing for this purpose.
<<elseif $g.slaver.isHasTrait('bg_mercenary')>>
The daily combat practice had ensured <<their $g.slaver>> survival as a mercenary, and <<they $g.slaver>> slaver|is not keen on forgetting it anytime soon.
<<else>>
The daily combat practice was drilled deep within <<their $g.slaver>> psyche by <<their $g.slaver>> previous army instructor, and it stays true even to the current day.
<</if>>
<<if $g.you.isHasAnyTraitExact(['bg_knight', 'bg_mercenary', 'bg_soldier'])>>
It's something you can relate very well -- after all, you too were once a
<<if $g.you.isHasTrait('bg_knight')>>
knight, and hard training was something you got used to.
<<elseif $g.you.isHasTrait('bg_mercenary')>>
mercenary, and you had to train to survive in the unforgiving business.
<<else>>
soldier, being drilled by your instructions for very long hours.
<</if>>
<</if>>
</p>

<p>
In fact, right now <<they $g.slaver>> slaver|is practicing, swinging <<their $g.slaver>> <<uweapon $g.slaver>> back and forth while counting.
<<They $g.slaver>> is
<<if $g.slaver.isHasBreasts()>>
shirtless, with only <<their $g.slaver>> underwear to cover <<their $g.slaver>> <<ubreasts $g.slaver>>. The muscles underneath contract and flex with <<their $g.slaver>> every move.
<<else>>
shirtless, <<their $g.slaver>>
<<ubreasts $g.slaver>> contracting and flexing with <<their $g.slaver>> every move.
<</if>>
It is actually quite sexy looking at <<therace $g.slaver>> training the various parts of <<their $g.slaver>> muscles.
</p>

<<choose>>

<<opt "Spar with <<them $g.slaver>>">>

<p>
You bring your own <<uweapon $g.you>> and approach <<yourrep $g.slaver>>. <<Therace $g.slaver>> slaver|is more than happy to have a training partner, breaking the monotony of training alone, and the two of you proceed to spar earnestly.
</p>


<<if $g.you.isHasAnyTraitExact(['bg_knight', 'bg_mercenary', 'bg_soldier'])>>

<p>
Given your background, you are no stranger to practice fights.
You know what maneuvers need the most practice, what are the moves to look out for,
and most importantly how to avoid unnecessary injuries.
By the end, both you and <<yourrep $g.slaver>> were completely drenched in sweat,
but both of you are smiling in the satisfaction of a good training session.
Having sweat together, it feels like you found a new friend in <<rep $g.slaver>>.
</p>

<<run setup.qc.FriendshipWithYou('slaver', 2000).apply($gQuest)>>

<<else>>

<<set _res = setup.Skill.skillCheckCompare($unit.player, $g.slaver, setup.skill.combat)>>

<p>
<<if _res == 2>>
Unfortunately, your combat prowess is simply too good, and before you realize it, <<yourrep $g.slaver>> slaver|is lying injured in front of you.
<<run setup.qc.Injury('slaver', 1).apply($gQuest)>>
<<elseif _res == 1>>
It was close, but you manage to clutch the sparring fight out and win against the
former
<<if $g.slaver.isHasTrait('bg_knight')>>
knight.
<<elseif $g.slaver.isHasTrait('bg_mercenary')>>
mercenary.
<<else>>
soldier.
<</if>>
<<elseif _res == -1>>
It was close, but the former <<if $g.slaver.isHasTrait('bg_knight')>>
knight
<<elseif $g.slaver.isHasTrait('bg_mercenary')>>
mercenary
<<else>>
soldier
<</if>>
catches you off-guard and cause you to fall flat into the ground, signifying your defeat.
<<else>>
Unfortunately, your combat prowess is nowhere near <<reps $g.slaver>>, and <<they $g.slaver>> accidentally injured you during the practice even after so much holding back.
<<run setup.qc.Injury('you', 1).apply($gQuest)>>
<</if>>
Still, it was all in good fun, and the two of you become closer through the exercise.
<<run setup.qc.FriendshipWithYou('slaver', 200).apply($gQuest)>>
</p>

<</if>>

<<opt "Watch <<them $g.slaver>> train">>

<p>
It's quite mesmerizing how <<rep $g.slaver>> slaver|is able to maintain a rhythm swinging <<their $g.slaver>> <<uweapon $g.slaver>> while counting out loud. Your focus starts to switch too â€” while initially you were just looking at <<their $g.slaver>> sweaty <<ubody $g.slaver>>, you start to catch some of the techniques <<they $g.slaver>> slaver|was using to keep the weapon steady.
<<if $g.you.isHasAnyTraitExact(['bg_knight', 'bg_mercenary', 'bg_soldier'])>>
These enhance upon your previous training as a
<<if $g.you.isHasTrait('bg_knight')>>
knight,
<<elseif $g.you.isHasTrait('bg_mercenary')>>
mercenary,
<<else>>
soldier,
<</if>>
and you feel as if you have learned a great deal from the experience.
<<run setup.qc.ExpUnit('you', 12).apply($gQuest)>>
<<else>>
In the end, you feel you've learned a thing or two from just watching the slaver exercised.
<<run setup.qc.ExpUnit('you', 2).apply($gQuest)>>
<</if>>
</p>
