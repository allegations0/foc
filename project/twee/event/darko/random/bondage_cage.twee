:: Event_bondage_cage [nobr]
<p>
Among the many shops that now reside within your fort complex is the <<rep
setup.buildingtemplate.workshop>> is the blacksmith shop, currently being run by a <<urace
$g.tenant>> named <<rep $g.tenant>>. The <<man $g.tenant>> is a burly
grizzled <<urace $g.tenant>>, and <<their $g.tenant>> arms are covered by
bulky muscles from <<their $g.tenant>> daily work.
</p>

<p>
<<Yourrep $g.slaver>> can often be seen in the fort too — sometimes just chatting with the owner, and some other times actually helping out with <<them $g.tenant>>. As you recall, <<rep $g.slaver>> used to be a blacksmith <<themself $g.slaver>>, when they often made
<<if $g.slaver.getHomeland() == setup.Text.Race.REGIONS.city>>
craftmen's tools for the various people living in the <<lore region_city>>.
<<elseif $g.slaver.getHomeland() == setup.Text.Race.REGIONS.vale>>
slave cages for the various taverns in the <<lore region_vale>>.
<<elseif $g.slaver.getHomeland() == setup.Text.Race.REGIONS.forest>>
iron bows for the hunters of the <<lore region_forest>>.
<<elseif $g.slaver.getHomeland() == setup.Text.Race.REGIONS.desert>>
weapons for the raiders of the <<lore region_desert>>.
<<elseif $g.slaver.getHomeland() == setup.Text.Race.REGIONS.deep>>
weapon and armor to fight the dangers of the <<lore region_deep>>.
<<elseif $g.slaver.getHomeland() == setup.Text.Race.REGIONS.sea>>
various devices from the many needs in the land beyond the <<lore region_sea>>.
<<elseif $g.slaver.getHomeland() == setup.Text.Race.REGIONS.mist>>
demonic bondage tools in the land beyond <<lore concept_mist>>.
<<else>>
many weapons in the land far beyond <<lore geo_mestia>>.
<</if>>
The resident blacksmith enjoys the company of your slaver, and occasional help too.
</p>

<<if $g.you.isHasTrait('bg_metalworker')>>
<p>
You were a former blacksmith too, once. And it did not escape your keen eyes
that <<yourrep $g.slaver>>, together with the resident blacksmith were making something in the smith.
You decided to roll up your sleeves and headed into the forge, to help out whenever you have free time.
They remained secretive of what they are making, however, but you still helped out whenever you can,
be it cooling some non descript iron bars, or hammering away some sturdy nails.
</p>
<</if>>

<p>
When you enter your office today, you found a
<<if $g.you.isHasTrait('bg_metalworker')>>
gigantic
<<else>>
big
<</if>>
box
covered with a clothes, together with a small card on top of it. It's a gift from <<yourrep $g.slaver>>, for
<<if $g.you.isHasTrait('bg_metalworker')>>
your help with the smithing, but more important for
<</if>>
the long time you've been having <<therace $g.slaver>> in your company. Opening the covering, you find
<<if $g.you.isHasTrait('bg_metalworker')>>
  several <<rep setup.item.f_slavebed_good_slaver>>s
<<else>>
  a <<rep setup.item.f_slavebed_good_slaver>>
<</if>>
inside — unlike normal slave cages, there are holes for all four limbs to be secured in, for more kinky plays or for punishment when they get too naughty. A unique present, that must surely be hand-crafted by your slaver and the resident blacksmith of your fort.
</p>

<p>
It doesn't happen often, but sometimes being the leader of a slaving company brings warmth to your heart, knowing that your slavers, despite how lazy, greedy, and incompetent they usually appear to be, still appreciate your leadership.
</p>
