<p>
After five full weeks, you feel refreshed and ready to go back to your work.
But that's not all! In your absence, <<yourrep $g.them>> also
<<if $gQuest.getSeed() % 3 == 0>>
made a lot of money out of seasonal contracts.
<<run setup.qc.Money(5000).apply($gQuest)>>
<<elseif $gQuest.getSeed() % 3 == 1>>
found a particularly rare potion.
<<run setup.qc.Item(setup.item.potion_luck).apply($gQuest)>>
<<elseif $gQuest.getSeed() % 3 == 2>>
smoothed things out with the <<rep $g.them.getHomeCompany()>>.
<<run setup.qc.Favor($g.them.getHomeCompany(), 250).apply($gQuest)>>
<</if>>
All in all, it was a good five weeks for you, and you are quite eager to return back to your company, after thanking the experienced <<rep $g.them>> for <<their $g.them>> help, of course.
</p>
