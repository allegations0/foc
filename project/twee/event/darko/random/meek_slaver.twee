:: Event_meek_slaver [nobr]
<p>
<<Yourrep $g.slaver>> came from a rather unflattering background.
Prior to becoming your slaver, <<they $g.slaver>> slaver|was
<<if $g.slaver.isHasTrait('bg_unemployed')>>
unemployed, living on the streets.
<<else>>
a lowly slave.
<</if>>
As a result, <<theslaver $g.slaver>> slaver|is awkwardly meek, and some would even go as far to say that <<they $g.slaver>> slaver|is not suitable as slaver.
<<if $g.slaver.isHasTrait('per_aggressive')>>
Nobody dares to say it out loud in front of the aggressive <<urace $g.slave>> though.
<<elseif $g.slaver.isHasTrait('face_scary') or $g.slaver.isHasTrait('skill_intimidating')>>
Nobody dares to say it out loud in front of the intimidating <<urace $g.slave>> though.
<<elseif $g.slaver.isHasTrait('muscle_verystrong')>>
Nobody dares to say it out loud in front of the hulkingly muscular <<urace $g.slave>> though.
<<elseif $g.slaver.isHasTrait('height_giant')>>
Nobody dares to say it out loud in front of the gigantic <<urace $g.slave>> though.
<</if>>
</p>

<p>
<<Their $g.slaver>> meekness makes for an awkward scene today. <<Yourrep $g.other>> is in the middle of playing with a slave <<rep $g.slave>> in the dungeons, and when <<therace $g.other>> other|shout a degrading command, <<rep $g.slaver>> goes perfectly stiff, <<their $g.slaver>>
<<if $g.slaver.isHasTrait('bg_unemployed')>>
prior life living on the streets makes them extra sensitive to any and all potential source of "income".
<<else>>
prior life as a slave making them involuntarily pay more attention to dominant commands.
<</if>>
Not wanting <<rep $g.other>> to realize what has happened, <<rep $g.slaver>> quietly exits the place, not realizing that you were watching all the time.
</p>

<<choose>>

<<opt "Try to address this issue">>

<p>
This is a concerning behavior as slaver, so you approach <<therace $g.slaver>> some time later when <<they $g.slaver>> slaver|is alone. <<They $g.slaver>> slaver|try to feign ignorance, but when switch to a more commanding tone, <<their $g.slaver>> stiffness returned.
You tell <<them $g.slaver>> that this won't do, and you spend the next couple of days trying to train the habit out of the slaver.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, days of specialized training are not sufficient to remove the years-induced habit. Despite this, the slaver seems to appreciate your concern, and the two of you grow closer throughout the attempt.
</p>

<<run setup.qc.FriendshipWithYou('slaver', 200).apply($gQuest)>>

<<opt "Take advantage of the issue">>

<p>
Deciding for some fun, you approach <<therace $g.slaver>> before using your most commanding tone to order the slaver to kneel before you. <<They $g.slaver>> reflexively does so, and before <<they $g.slaver>> slaver|realize what's happening you
<<ustrippantsand $g.you>>
shove your
<<udickorstrap $g.you>> down <<reps $g.slaver>> throat.
<<They $g.slaver>> slaver|gag at the feeling of your shaft lodged inside slaver|their throat, but before slaver|they slaver|was able to protest, you again use your commanding tone to order slaver|them to take it all in.
Eventually, slaver|their
<<if $g.slaver.isHasTrait('bg_slave')>>
slave
<<else>>
beggar
<</if>>
mentality takes over, and slaver|they helplessly serve you all night long.
</p>

<p>
<<if $g.slaver.isSubmissive()>>
Surprisingly, the submissive slut quite like the rough treatment, and your relationship somehow grow as a result.
<<run setup.qc.FriendshipWithYou('slaver', 200).apply($gQuest)>>

<<else>>
Understandably, <<they $g.slaver>> slaver|like you less now.
<<run setup.qc.FriendshipWithYou('slaver', -200).apply($gQuest)>>

<</if>>
</p>
