:: Event_wise_words [nobr]
<p>
Your mood has been quite sour in the recent weeks, and the future looks kinda bleak to you these few days. In fact, you
<<set _trait = $unit.player.getTraitWithTag('trauma')>>
<<if _trait>>
<<= setup.Text.Unit.Trait.description($unit.player, _trait)>> these days.
<</if>>
But you won't stop that from messing with your work, and as you recall,
<<yourrep $g.slaver>> slaver|have arranged to meet personally with you today.
</p>

<p>
To your surprise, <<they $g.slaver>> slaver|want to address the
<<if _trait>>
<<= setup.Text.Unit.Trait.noun($unit.player, _trait)>>
<</if>>
that slaver|have been plaguing you.
<<if $g.slaver.isHasTrait('per_evil')>>
You know the slaver is generally evil, but you're too tired to think about that and just hope that <<they $g.slaver>> slaver|have your best interest for now.
<<elseif $g.slaver.isHasTrait('per_lunatic')>>
You know the slaver is a lunatic, but you're too tired to think about that and just hope that <<they $g.slaver>> slaver|have your best interest for now.
<<elseif $g.slaver.isHasTrait('per_cruel')>>
You know the slaver is generally cruel, but you're too tired to think about that and just hope that <<they $g.slaver>> slaver|have your best interest for now.
<<else>>
Seeing no reason to mistrust the slaver, you tiredly sigh and just follow along with whatever <<they $g.slaver>> slaver|have planned for you.
<</if>>
<<They $g.slaver>> then gently guide you in a spiritual meditation, a discipline
the
<<if $g.slaver.isHasTrait('bg_monk')>>
ex-monk
<<else>>
wiseman
<</if>>
is very familiar with.
Initially, it is difficult for you to clean your thoughts, but <<theslaver $g.slaver>> keeps guiding you, almost hypnotically through the entire procedure.
<<if $g.you.isHasAnyTraitExact(['bg_monk', 'bg_wiseman'])>>
Your past taught you how to meditate, however, and it helped tremendously in following <<reps $g.slaver>> guidance.
<</if>>
</p>

<p>
Before you realize, you feel the burderns starting to lift from your shoulders. At the end of the procedure, you are fast asleep, and <<they $g.slaver>> slaver|decide to leave you be for today and leave your office. When you wake up sometime later, you feel refreshed, as if a great burden has been lifted from you.
</p>

<p>
<<if $g.slaver.isHasTrait('per_evil') or
$g.slaver.isHasTrait('per_lunatic') or
$g.slaver.isHasTrait('per_cruel')>>
You've noticed that your pockets are slightly lighter now â€” it seems the
<<if $g.slaver.isHasTrait('per_lunatic')>>
lunatic
<<elseif $g.slaver.isHasTrait('per_cruel')>>
cruel
<<else>>
evil
<</if>>
slaver has taken some of your money as payment for <<their $g.slaver>> services. But considering how effective it was, you'd gladly pay twice over for the same treatment anywhere else.
<<run setup.qc.Money(-1000).apply($gQuest)>>

<</if>>

</p>
