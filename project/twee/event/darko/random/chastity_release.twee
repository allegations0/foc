:: Event_chastity_relief [nobr]
<p>
    You keep <<yourrep $g.slave>> in your bedchamber mostly chaste: their <<udick $g.slave>> unable to get anywhere near erect inside its tight and confining <<ucgenital $g.slave>>.
    <<Their $g.slave>> <<uballs $g.slave>> looks very full as well.
    <<if $g.slave.isCanSee()>>
        Looking at <<their $g.slave>> <<ueyes $g.slave>>,
    <<else>>
        You can't see <<their $g.slave>> eyes past <<their $g.slave>> <<uceyes $g.slave>>, but
    <</if>>
    it was obvious that the <<urace $g.slave>> is pent up and desperate for cum.
</p>

<<choose>>
<<opt "Release the poor cock from its cage and decide later whether to allow it to cum">>

    <p>
        It has been some time since <<reps $g.slave>> cock was uncaged, and you've mercifully decided to release the cock from its cage. The slave
        <<if $g.slave.isCanTalk()>>
            moans in gratitude, being unable to talk.
        <<else>>
            utters a "Thank you, Master" for the respite that <<they $g.slave>> know won't last long.
        <</if>>
        <<They $g.slave>> slave|is obedient enough to know not to ask for permission to cum, but you can basically see the desire rising extremely quickly in <<their $g.slave>> body.
    </p>

    <p>
        Grinning <<uadv $g.you>>, you press your <<ucfeet $g.you>> on <<their $g.slave>> dick. The pain intertwines with stimulation, and <<they $g.slave>> can't help but get hard under your <<ucfeet $g.you>>.
        <<if $g.slave.isMasochistic()>>
            The masochist loves the pain you cause on <<their $g.slave>> pathetic dick.
        <</if>>
        Before long, <<they $g.slave>> slave|look ready to release <<their $g.slave>> sizable load, despite the rough treatment you are giving <<them $g.slave>>. They wordlessly look at you, waiting for permission to release.
    </p>

    <<choose>>
    <<opt "Deny it at the end">>

        <p>
            With a <<uadj $g.you>> smile, you press your <<ucfeet $g.you>> harder to the point of sharp pain.
            <<if $g.slave.isMasochistic()>>
                While your intention is to use the pain to deny the pleasure, it backfired spectacularly on the
                masochistic slave.
                The pain only enhanced the pleasure, and <<they $g.slave>> came messily onto your <<ucfeet $g.you>>.
                <<Their $g.slave>> face was in an utter bliss, while you stare at your dirty <<ucfeet $g.you>> "defeated". Ah well, guess you'll just have to punish the slave later after making sure <<they $g.slave>> lick your <<ucfeet $g.you>> squeaky clean with <<their $g.slave>> tongue.
            <<else>>
            <</if>>
            The sudden pain was enough to block the orgasm. You repeat the gentle and cruel pressure, bringing <<them $g.slave>> close to orgasm a few more times only to deny it at the end.
            Once you had enough, you lock the poor unreleased dick back into its <<ucgenital $g.slave>>, not really caring about how the frustrated slave must have felt. If anything, <<they $g.slave>> should be grateful <<they $g.slave>> had proven amusing to <<their $g.slave>> owner â€” after all, what else is a slave good for?
        </p>

        <<run setup.qc.FriendshipWithYou('slave', -50).apply($gQuest)>>

    <<opt "Give them sweet release">>

        <p>
            Right after you utter the word, <<they $g.slave>> ejaculated without care. Strings and string of cum that built up over the past weeks shoot down the floor,
            <<if $g.slave.isHasTrait('balls_titanic')>>
                and it just won't stop coming out of those <<uballs $g.slave>>. Before long, an extremely thick layer of cum were coating the flooring.
            <<elseif $g.slave.isHasTrait('balls_large')>>
                leaving a big mess on the floor.
            <<elseif $g.slave.isHasTrait('balls_small')>>
                and while the overall quantity isn't that great, it still makes a mess of the floor.
            <<else>>
                although the quantity of each release is pathetically small.
            <</if>>
            When <<they $g.slave>> finished, you lock <<their $g.slave>> <<ucgenital $g.slave>> back and made <<them $g.slave>> lick up every drop of <<their $g.slave>> own cum off the floor.
        </p>

        <<run setup.qc.FriendshipWithYou('slave', 50).apply($gQuest)>>

    <</choose>>


<<opt "Keep the cock in its rightful place inside the cage">>

    <p>
        Pets are not meant to receive pleasure, only to give pleasure to their owners. You decide to keep <<them $g.slave>> locked and needy, as any good pet should be.
        Instead of releasing them, you
        <<if $g.you.isHasDick()>>
            let out your own erection,
        <<else>>
            grab a nearby strap-on and put it on,
        <</if>>
        and order your slave to come and swallow it whole.
        The pent-up <<urace $g.slave>> had no choice but to obey.
        <<They $g.slave>> gave
        <<if $g.slave.isHasTrait('training_oral_master')>>
            a masterful blowjob,
        <<elseif $g.slave.isHasTrait('training_oral_advanced')>>
            a skilled blowjob,
        <<elseif $g.slave.isHasTrait('training_oral_basic')>>
            a passable blowjob,
        <<else>>
            a barely passable blowjob,
        <</if>>
        until you finally
        <<if $g.you.isHasDick()>>
            came inside <<their $g.slave>> mouth
        <<else>>
            climaxed
        <</if>>
        while the slave's own dick throb painfully within their tight <<ucgenital $g.slave>>.
    </p>

<</choose>>
