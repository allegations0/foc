:: Event_living_god [nobr]
<p>
Even among your slavers, <<yourrep $g.slaver>> is rather special. <<Therace $g.slaver>> exudes an aura unlike any other, drawing many people in. In fact, before <<they $g.slaver>> became a slaver, <<they $g.slaver>> slaver|was quite used to being worshipped by others.
</p>

<p>
Despite having known the slaver for quite some time, you're still unsure what is it exactly that draws people to <<them $g.slaver>>, but you have no plan on making the talent go to waste. Instead, you <<uadv $unit.player>> approached <<rep $g.slaver>>, suggesting to put the talent to good use. Why not setup a small shrine in your <<rep setup.buildingtemplate.market>>, dedicated to <<their $g.slaver>> likeliness, where people can come and worship <<them $g.slaver>> as some sort of deity? Surely there are some fun to be had, as well as coin if one can look carefully enough...
</p>

<p>
<<if $g.slaver.isHasTrait('per_honorable')>>
Of course you don't phrase it like that to the honorable <<urace $g.slaver>>. Instead, you word it as making a platform for <<them $g.slaver>> to share <<their $g.slaver>> wisdom. You skipped the part where the "grateful sheeps" would happily donate <<their $g.slaver>> worldy belongings, of course.
<<else>>

<<if $g.slaver.isHasTrait('per_evil')>>
You didn't even have to try to convince the slaver â€” the evil slaver relishes your cruel idea, and happily go with the plan.
<<else>>
It took you some convincing, but the jingling of coin finally convinces the slaver to go with the plan.
<</if>>
Setup a shrine, get some followers, and take whatever "offerings" the grateful worshippers would surely bring.

<</if>>
</p>

<p>
All you need to do is some money to fund the shrine, as well as a couple of slavers to build it.
</p>
