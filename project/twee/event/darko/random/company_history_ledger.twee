As you work as usual in your office today, <<yourrep $g.slaver>> slaver|come knocking on the office door. Entering, the slaver slaver|is carrying a large stack of books, almost covering <<their $g.slaver>> entire face.
<<if $g.slaver.isHasTrait('per_attentive')>>
But despite that, the attentive <<urace $g.slaver>> managed to maintain <<their $g.slaver>> balance and place the tall stack of books on your desk. You
<<else>>
You are not surprised when <<therace $g.slaver>> lost balance and the books scattered across the floor of your office.
After you help the
<<if $g.slaver.isHasTrait('per_dreamy')>>
clumsy
<</if>>
slaver pick up all the books and place them on your desk, you
<</if>>
then ask what these books are about.
</p>

<p>
Apparently, the ex-scholar has been spending quite a time chronicling your company's misdeeds into a series of books. Indeed, the first book seemingly detail the start of your company, from its humble beginnings where the fort is nothing but a ruined remnants of a long-lost castle.
<<if $g.slaver.getSpeech() == setup.speech.friendly>>
The book is very fun to read, almost like a storybook.
<<elseif $g.slaver.getSpeech() == setup.speech.bold>>
The book tells your company's story in a grand way, and sometimes even take creative liberties in explaining the more mundane things.
<<elseif $g.slaver.getSpeech() == setup.speech.cool>>
The book gets straight to the point, and is very easy to complete in one go.
<<elseif $g.slaver.getSpeech() == setup.speech.witty>>
The book is full of humor, and you laugh at some of the jokes being told here and there.
<<elseif $g.slaver.getSpeech() == setup.speech.debauched>>
The book is very fun to read, no small thanks to the many sexual snippets being inserted here and there â€” accurate ones too!
<</if>>
</p>

<<if $g.you.isHasTrait('bg_scholar')>>
<p>
But <<yourrep $g.slaver>> is not the only slaver around who had thought about writing such a chronicle.
You were a scholar too once, and you had been writing a series of similar books as well.
You invited <<rep $g.slaver>> to come over to one of your bookshelves, and
<<they $g.slaver>> observed in awe at the multiple volumes of books that you had penned,
noting all the achievements your company had done up to this point.
</p>

<p>
Realizing the common shared interest, you and <<yourrep $g.slaver>> engaged in deep and
productive discussions over these books. In the end, you were convinced by <<yourrep $g.slaver>>
that these books should be made public in your fort.
After all, what good is knowledge if it isn't shared?
</p>

<<else>>

<p>
This is an amazing chronicle, and while the book won't go anywhere, you might want to share it with the rest of your company.

<<else>>
slaver|look very pleased with <<themself $g.slaver>>
<</if>>
by the book's reception. <<name $g.slaver>> slaver|is on the tongue of every conversation that night, and <<therace $g.slaver>>'s mood increase in the coming weeks.
</p>

<<run setup.qc.FriendshipWithYou('slaver', 5).apply($gQuest)>>

<<opt "Keep it in your office for a day and share it with visitors">>
