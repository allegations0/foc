:: Event_morphing_cage [nobr]
<p>
    You worked until quite late today, and by the time you finally finish with your work, the sun has set. Exhausted, you went straight for your bedchamber.
    <<Yourrep $g.slave>> slave|is inside, as usual,
    and <<they $g.slave>>
    <<if $g.slave.isHasTrait('training_obedience_basic')>>
        greets you
        <<if $g.slave.isHasTrait('training_obedience_advanced')>>
            obediently,
        <<else>>
            reluctantly,
        <</if>>
        <<if $g.slave.isCanTalk()>>
            "Welcome home, <<Master $g.you>>".
        <<else>>
            doing <<their $g.slave>> best to convey <<their $g.slave>> greetings wordlessly.
        <</if>>
    <<else>>
        looks at you with untamed deviance.
    <</if>>
</p>

<p>
    Looking at the <<rep setup.item.f_slavebed_master>> inside your chamber,
    you
    <<if $g.slave.isHasTrait('training_obedience_basic')>>
        can lock <<them $g.slave>> in bondage all night long, if you'd like.
    <<else>>
        can punish <<them $g.slave>> for <<their $g.slave>> insolence, if you'd like.
    <</if>>
</p>

<<choose>>
<<opt "Morph the cage and lock the slave in a punishing doggy position all night long">>

    <p>
        You morph the magical cage, forming arms, neck, and legs restraints at just the right heights to force the slave into
        an uncomfortable doggy position
        inside. You then
        <<if $g.slave.isHasTrait('training_obedience_basic')>>
            order the obedient slave to get in and
        <<else>>
            force the deviant slave into place and
        <</if>>
        lock their wrists and ankles in place.
    </p>

    <p>
        They are now stuck in a doggy position, and you complete the night bondage with a dildo gag, a buttplug, and some weighs to weigh down their nipples.
        The slave moans in pain
        <<if $g.slave.isMasochistic()>>
            and pleasure
        <</if>>
        ,
        but you are too tired to care and went to sleep, oblivious to the moans that echoes throughout the night.
    </p>

    <p>
        When you release the slave next morning, <<they $g.slave>>
        collapsed in exhaustion.
        It seems the poor <<urace $g.slave>> could not get any sleep last night, and understandbly why too.
        <<Their $g.slave>> poor nipples are throbbing in pain from the night long bondage, and <<their $g.slave>> limbs are numb from being locked in place for so long.

        <<if $g.slave.isHasTrait('training_obedience_basic')>>
            The slave has become more fearful of you.
            <<run setup.qc.FriendshipWithYou('slave', -50).apply($gQuest)>>
        <<else>>
            The harsh punishment finally broke the slave, who has now become more obedient to you.
            <<run setup.qc.Trait('slave', setup.trait.training_obedience_basic).apply($gQuest)>>
        <</if>>
    </p>


<<opt "Morph the cage and lock the slave in a comfortable missionary position all night long">>

    <<if $g.slave.isMale()>>
    <<else>>
        <<questimage 'morphing_cage_missionary_female.jpg'>>
    <</if>>

    <p>
        You morph the magical cage, forming arms, neck, and legs restraints at just the right heights to force the slave into
        a somewhat bearable position, lying up with <<their $g.slave>> back on the floor
        inside. You then
        <<if $g.slave.isHasTrait('training_obedience_basic')>>
            order the obedient slave to get in and
        <<else>>
            force the deviant slave into place and
        <</if>>
        lock their wrists and ankles in place.
    </p>

    <p>
        They are now stuck in a missionary position. You put a couple of cushions for <<their $g.slave>> comfort under them, before shoving a couple of magical dildos up <<their $g.slave>> <<uhole $g.slave>> to pleasure <<them $g.slave>> all night.
        You are too tired to see <<their $g.slave>> reaction and go to bed, but it was clear from <<their $g.slave>>
        <<if $g.slave.isHasTrait('training_obedience_basic')>>
            moans that <<they $g.slave>> seems to be enjoying <<themself $g.slave>>.
        <<else>>
            desperate moans that <<they $g.slave>> is not enjoying the treat.
        <</if>>
    </p>

    <p>
        When you release the slave next morning, <<they $g.slave>>
        collapsed in exhaustion.
        It seems the poor <<urace $g.slave>> could not get any sleep last night, and understandbly why too.
        <<if $g.slave.isHasTrait('training_obedience_basic')>>

            <<if $g.slave.isInChastity()>>
                <<Their $g.slave>> <<udick $g.slave>> painfully press against the chastity cage all night, preventing <<them $g.slave>> from resting at all.
                The poor slave still managed to let an incoherent thank you as you finally pull out the vibrating dildo, accepting that <<their $g.slave>> chastity will not be taken off anytime soon.
                <<run setup.qc.FriendshipWithYou('slave', -50).apply($gQuest)>>
            <<elseif !$g.slave.isCanOrgasm()>>
                Despite not being allowed to orgasm, you can see dried <<ucum $g.slave>> on the floor. <<They $g.slave>> knew it too, and hope your punishment will not be too severe...
            <<else>>
                <<if $g.slave.isHasDick()>>
                    Dried cum were splattered everywhere — it seems the slave had came multiple times during the night.
                <<else>>
                    Dried pussyjuice were littering the floor — it seems the slave climaxed multiple times during the night.

                <</if>>

                Being so thoroughly sexually satisfied makes the slave like you a little bit more.
                <<run setup.qc.FriendshipWithYou('slave', 50).apply($gQuest)>>
            <</if>>




        <<else>>
            The constant vibrating dildo induces unwanted pleasure for <<them $g.slave>> all night, and this finally broke the slave, who has now become more obedient to you.
            <<run setup.qc.Trait('slave', setup.trait.training_obedience_basic).apply($gQuest)>>
        <</if>>

    </p>
<</choose>>
