<<set _u = setup.getAnySlaver([$g.slaver])>>

<p>
<<Yourrep _u>> alerts you that a hopeful has arrived at your fort, asking to meet with <<yourrep $g.slaver>>. You almost berates <<rep _u>> for wasting your time with such unimportant information, that is until <<rep _u>> <<uadv _u>> points out that the <<girl $g.slave>>, whose name is <<rep $g.slave>>, is willing to be enslaved for some reason. Sensing a potential, you invites both the <<girl $g.slave>> and <<rep $g.slaver>> into your office.
</p>

<p>
The <<girl $g.slave>> who is admitted to your office quails a bit at the sight of <<rep $g.slaver>>, and you believe you can detect a bit of infatuation there, too. You wordlessly query <<rep _u>>, and <<they _u>> shakes <<their _u>> head, trying to come up with a possible explanation. Meanwhile, you start interviewing the potential slave. It appears that <<they $g.slave>> left home, in a settlement near the fort, just very recently. <<They $g.slave>>'s no innocent, and not destitute, and you're surprised <<they $g.slave>>'s done something this foolish.
</p>

<p>
After a short while, <<yourrep _u>> whispers to you,
"<<name $unit.player>>, I think I've seen the <<girl $g.slave>> around your fort for a couple of times now, and I remember spotting <<them $g.slave>> staring at <<yourrep $g.slaver>> with limpid eyes."
Rather than confronting <<them $g.slave>> directly, you probe the subject, and after some evasion <<they $g.slave>> finally admits that yes, <<they $g.slave>> did come here out of infatuation with <<rep $g.slaver>>.
Given how gorgeous <<therace $g.slaver>> slaver|is,
<<if $g.slaver.isHasTrait('muscle_verystrong')>>
as well as <<their $g.slaver>> bulging muscles,
<<elseif $g.slaver.isHasTrait('muscle_strong')>>
as well as <<their $g.slaver>> toned body,
<<elseif $g.slaver.isHasTrait('muscle_verythin')>>
as well as <<their $g.slaver>> very attractive waist,
<<elseif $g.slaver.isHasTrait('muscle_thin')>>
as well as <<their $g.slaver>> attractive waist,
<<elseif $g.slaver.isHasTrait('breast_large')>>
as well as <<their $g.slaver>> bountiful bosoms,
<<elseif $g.slaver.isHasTrait('dick_large')>>
as well as <<their $g.slaver>> eye-catching bulge,
<</if>>
it's not a surprise that <<rep $g.slaver>> slaver|attract an admirer or two, but not to the point of enslaving <<themself $g.slave>> just to get near with <<their $g.slave>> love.
"Pretty fuckin' stupid," <<they $g.slave>> admits. "But I've come too far now. I just really want to live here with. With <<rep $g.slaver>>, I guess. If that means being a slave, that's okay. Can I be your servant, maybe?"
</p>




:: Opportunity_attractive_slaver_0 [nobr]
Enslave <<them $g.slave>>


:: Opportunity_attractive_slaver_0_flavor [nobr]
<p>
You ask <<rep $g.slaver>> to personally escort <<them $g.slave>> into the <<rep setup.buildingtemplate.slavepens>> to begin <<their $g.slave>> new life.
<<They $g.slave>> looks doubtful, obviously wondering whether <<they $g.slave>> slave|have made a huge mistake. <<They $g.slave>>'s legally your property, now; you can fulfill <<their $g.slave>> wishes for a gentler duty in your fort, or not. <<Their $g.slave>> suspicion that <<they $g.slave>> slave|have blundered into something terrible no longer matters.
</p>




:: Opportunity_attractive_slaver_1 [nobr]
Recruit <<them $g.slave>> and try to make <<rep $g.slaver>> reciprocate back


:: Opportunity_attractive_slaver_1_flavor [nobr]
<p>
You decided that this is <<reps $g.slave>> lucky day, and instead offers the hopeful <<urace $g.slave>> a position in your company as a slaver. When <<they $g.slave>> just sits there in disbelief, you repeat your offer.
"Thank you, thank you, I will never forget this," <<they $g.slave>> almost tearfully says, "I promise to be loyal and be dedicated to your cause.".
</p>

<p>
In the coming days, <<rep $g.slave>> would "accidentally" be assigned to the same tasks with <<rep $g.slaver>>. The two of them might not become instant lovers, but their relationship progresses significantly.
</p>




:: Opportunity_attractive_slaver_2 [nobr]
Send <<them $g.slave>> away


:: Opportunity_attractive_slaver_2_flavor [nobr]
<p>
You're not that cruel to enslave someone who does not deserve to be enslaved, and while the <<girl $g.slave>> may not appreciate your actions now, <<they $g.slave>> will understand how lucky <<they $g.slave>> slave|was once <<they $g.slave>> sees how used and abused the life of a slave is. <<Rep $g.slaver>> approves of your deed.
</p>
