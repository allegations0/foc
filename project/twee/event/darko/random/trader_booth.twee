<p>
About this time of the day, <<yourrep $g.slaver>> can usually be found
<<uhobbyverb $g.slaver>>. However, today <<they $g.slaver>> slaver|is not in
<<their $g.slaver>> usual spot. Instead, you spot the ex-merchant opening up
a small booth in your <<rep setup.buildingtemplate.market>>.
</p>

<p>
Coming over, you see that <<therace $g.slaver>> is opening up a one-day-only booth, selling a "specialty product" of your company with a steep discount: the slave <<rep $g.slave>> is fully bound and placed on the table, while
<<if $g.slave.isHasTrait('breast_huge')>>
the nipples on <<their $g.slave>> milky breasts are attached to some sort of suction pipe, which ends in
<<else>>
some sort of pip is attached deep inside <<their $g.slave>> urethra, and ending in
<</if>>
a box with a tap.
</p>

<p>
As you recall, <<rep $g.slaver>> used to be a merchant before joining your company, and it seems <<therace $g.slaver>> sees the potential profit in your particularly well-endowed <<urace $g.slave>> slave. Seeing you approach, <<they $g.slaver>>
<<if $g.slaver.getSpeech() == setup.speech.friendly>>
give you a friendly smile and asks if you'd like to try some of the product first.
<<elseif $g.slaver.getSpeech() == setup.speech.bold>>
almost screams to greet you and ask you to come and try the product.
<<elseif $g.slaver.getSpeech() == setup.speech.cool>>
gives you a stoic nod, before inviting you to come and sample the product.
<<elseif $g.slaver.getSpeech() == setup.speech.witty>>
points invitingly at the slave's
<<if $g.slave.isHasTrait('breast_huge')>>
tits.
<<else>>
balls.
<</if>>
<<elseif $g.slaver.getSpeech() == setup.speech.debauched>>
slaps the slave's exposed ass cheeks, before asking you to come over and sample the produce of the well-abused slave.
<</if>>
</p>

<<opt "Sample it">>

<p>
When you said yes, <<therace $g.slaver>> <<uadv $g.slaver>> grins and takes
a large dildo from under the booth table. The slave's eyes' widen at its
size, and your slaver unceremoniously shove it up inside the slave's anus
while simultaneously stimulating <<their $g.slave>> <<ugenital $g.slave>>.
Before long, you can see the slave climaxing, and at the same time, a steady stream of
<<if $g.slave.isHasTrait('breast_huge')>>
milk
<<else>>
cum
<</if>>
pours from the tap and into the glass below.
The
<<if $g.slave.isHasTrait('breast_huge')>>
gigantic tits aren't just for show, and it produces a glass of milk effortlessly.
<<else>>
gigantic balls aren't just for show, and it produces a pint of cum effortlessly.
<</if>>
Other visitors near the <<rep setup.buildingtemplate.market>> see the demonstration and become quite interested in the booth. Soon, many people visit to the impromptu booth, and by the end of the day, <<yourrep $g.slaver>> looks quite satisfied with <<themself $g.slaver>>, having cashed in quite a bit of money from the fully-drained slave.

<<opt "Help with the booth">>

<p>
With a different goal in mind, you order for a
<<if $g.slave.isHasTrait('breast_huge')>>
glass of milk.

<p>
Instead of tasting it, however, you walk around the busy <<rep setup.buildingtemplate.market>> and offer the sample to other visitors around. Intrigued by the taste, many decide to come to the impromptu booth, and the booth makes quite a lot of profit by abusing <<rep $g.slave>> that day, forcing the slave to
<<if $g.slave.isHasTrait('breast_huge')>>
lactate painfully
<<else>>
cum painfully
<</if>>
over and over again.
By the end of the day, the slave is on the brink of losing consciousness, but you and <<yourrep $g.slaver>> make quite a large profit from selling the goods.
