:: Event_magical_candlestick [nobr]
<p>
In the past few weeks, you've seen <<yourrep $g.slaver>> doing something with
one of your slaves, <<rep $g.slave>>. It's unclear what <<therace $g.slaver>>
slaver|have been doing, but
<<if $g.you.isHasAnyTraitExact(['bg_mystic', 'bg_apprentice'])>>
given the trace of magic you can sense in the air -- something you learned
when you were a magic student yourself,
<<else>>
given <<their $g.slaver>>
<<their $g.slaver>> past as a
<<if $g.slaver.isHasTrait('bg_mystic')>>
wizard
<<else>>
student of magic
<</if>>
and hence <<their $g.slaver>>
proclivity towards
magic, and given the slave's magical abilities,
<</if>>
it's probably something
related to the arcane.
</p>

<p>
Today, <<rep $g.slaver>> slaver|have come over to you, thanking you for all
the things you've done for your company and for <<them $g.slaver>>. Just when
you suspect the worst, <<they $g.slaver>> instead slaver|give you a present
of gratitude: a magically enchanted candlestick to decorate your bedchamber
with. Despite looking like a regular candlestick, it emits no heat, and
perpetually glistens with a reddish color â€” no doubt fueled by magic.
According to <<therace $g.slaver>>, <<they $g.slaver>> slaver|have been
draining all the magical energies from the slave into the candlestick,
leaving the slave severely drained and needing a few weeks to recover.
</p>

<<if $g.you.isHasAnyTraitExact(['bg_mystic', 'bg_apprentice'])>>

<p>
However, drawing from your own vast knowledge of arcane matters,
you can sense that the device was somewhat unstable.
But you have an idea -- you could divide the energy among multiple vessels, and it should
bring it to a stable level.
You share your thoughts and idea with the <<urace $g.slaver>>, who ended up appreciating
your shared interest in mystic arts.
The next few days were spent with the both of you locked inside your office, making more and
more of these candlesticks.
You finished with a couple of the valuable furniture, ready to be installed or sold.
But more importantly, your friendship with <<yourrep $g.slaver>> grew.
The journey is the real reward, after all.
</p>

<<else>>

<p>
You thank your slaver for such a thoughtful gift, and stow it in your office
for the time being. Judging from how severely drained the slave is, however,
you can only imagine the pain the slave must have endured being drained of
<<their $g.slave>> magical essence again and again.
<<if $g.slaver.isHasTrait('per_cruel')>>
Given <<reps $g.slaver>> sadistic nature, you have a feeling that the real reason why the slaver decide to make such an enchanted candlestick is to make the slave suffer from it...
<<elseif $g.slaver.isHasTrait('per_dominant')>>
Given <<reps $g.slaver>> dominant nature, you have a feeling that the real reason why the slaver decide to make such an enchanted candlestick is to satisfy <<their $g.slaver>> need to dominate others...
<<elseif $g.slaver.isHasTrait('per_evil')>>
Given <<reps $g.slaver>> evil nature, you have a feeling that the real reason why the slaver decide to make such an enchanted candlestick is because <<they $g.slaver>> slaver|want to torture the slave by making it...
<</if>>
</p>
