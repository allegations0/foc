:: Event_pilgrim_visit [nobr]
<p>
Your fort hosts a rather grand <<rep setup.buildingtemplate.temple>> that attracts visitors from near and far. One such visitors came from the <<lore region_sea>>, and, suitable impressed with your temple, would like to give something back in return. To your dismay, the pilgrim is poor and is lacking in money, but <<they $g.pilgrim>> pilgrim|is wise and knowledgeable in the southern arts of blessings. This could be a rare opportunity for you to personally ask for a blessing.
