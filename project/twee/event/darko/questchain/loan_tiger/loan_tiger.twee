<p>
It's not everyday that a slaver such as yourself receive visitors, but today
you are visited by a representative from the <<rep $company.bank>>. The
<<name $company.bank>> is perhaps the largest banking institution in the
region, and they are headquartered in the <<lore location_npc>> â€” a city in
the <<lore region_forest>> predominantly inhabited by <<rep setup.trait.subrace_neko>> people.
</p>

<p>
<<They $g.tiger>> tiger|introduce <<themself $g.tiger>> as <<rep $g.tiger>>.
"You must be <<name $g.you>>, the leader of a" - <<they $g.tiger>> tiger|pause a bit -
"new mercenary company in this area. <<name $g.tiger>> tiger|have heard of your
recent deeds, and is quite impressed." As it turns out, your company's
activities has reached the institution. You do not have to guess what such
institution wants from your company as <<rep $g.tiger>> tiger|proceed to open
<<their $g.tiger>> expensive-looking suitcase filled to the brim with
documents, and tiger|hand you over a loan agreement. "The bank and also <<name
$g.tiger>> trust that your company can benefit from this offer." - <<they
$g.tiger>> tiger|add.
</p>

<p>
You put the documents on your desk to read later. You then ask one of your
slavers to give the good <<urace $g.tiger>> a tour of your fort while you get back to
work.
