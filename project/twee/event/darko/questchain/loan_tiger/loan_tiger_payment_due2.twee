:: Event_loan_tiger_payment_due2 [nobr]
<p>
Some time ago, your company has fallen into a debt, and you had to borrow some money from the <<rep $company.bank>>. Today, a representative from the bank has arrived at your fort, demanding advance interest for your loan: a sum of <<money 5000>>.
<<if $unit.player.isHasTrait('per_attentive')>>
However, you are perceptive enough to notice that you are not yet at the deadline for your payment. In fact, the representative neko does not dress like a normal <<rep $company.bank>> representative at all â€” all you could know, <<they $g.neko>> might just be a swindler trying to trick you into paying something you should never pay to begin with.
<<elseif $unit.player.isHasTrait('per_dreamy')>>
<<else>>
You are perceptive enough to note that it is not yet time for the payment deadline, but perhaps this is just part of the bank's standard procedure.
<</if>>
</p>

<<choose>>

<<opt "Pay">>

<p>
You paid the money, and the neko departed immediately.
</p>

<p>
A few days later, you receive a missive from the <<rep $company.bank>> that a neko impersonator has been going around, pretending to be an employee of the bank.
It appears that you have been swindled by this particularly unscrupulous character...
</p>

<<run setup.qc.Money(-5000).apply($gQuest)>>

<<opt "Enslave the representative">>

<<set _u = setup.getAnySlaver()>>
<p>
You decided to instead enslave the representative.
Pretending to go to your coffers to collect the pay, you instead summoned
<<yourrep _u>>, and together you knocked the neko unconscious, before storing
<<them _u>> in the <<rep setup.buildingtemplate.slavepens>>.
</p>

<p>
A few days later, you receive a thank you letter from the <<rep $company.bank>> for arresting the neko impersonator. Supposedly, the thief has been masquerading as the bank's employee for some time, tarnishing its reputation. Your goodwill with the bank has increased as a result.
</p>

<<run setup.qc.Favor('bank', 100).apply($gQuest)>>
<<run setup.qc.Slave('neko', 'a|was trying to swindle you by pretending to be a representative of the Tiger bank').apply($gQuest)>>
