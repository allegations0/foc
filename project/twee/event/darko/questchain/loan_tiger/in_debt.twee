<p>
Unfortunately, due to one reason or another, your company has fallen into a crippling debt. Fortunately, the <<rep $company.bank>> has come to the rescue, lending your company <<money _loan>> to offset the debt. However, the loan does not come free, and you will have to pay them back with a steep interest, totaling <<money _total>> by next year. Given your financial situation, you are in unfortunately no situation to decline, and begrudgingly takes the money. Better start planning for how to pay them back...
