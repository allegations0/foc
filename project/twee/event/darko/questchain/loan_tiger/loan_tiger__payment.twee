<p>
A year ago, you borrowed some money from the <<rep $company.bank>>. Today,
the charming representative of the bank is back at your company to collect the loan together with the interest.
<<if $company.player.getMoney() >= 15000>>
You have allocated some funds for this purpose, which <<rep $g.tiger>>
happily takes.
"<<name $g.tiger>> is pleased to do business with you." - <<they $g.tiger>>
cordially tiger|say as they tiger|leave your fort with the bag of money.
<<else>>
Paying the money unfortunately puts your company in significant debt, but a promise is a
promise and <<rep $g.tiger>> takes the money away.
"<<name $g.tiger>> is pleased to do business with you, but <<name $g.tiger>>
hopes your company will continue doing well." - <<they $g.tiger>> apologetically
tiger|say as they leave your fort with the bag of money.
