<p>
Unfortunately, without the required ingredients and rituals, the plant that
<<rep $g.slaver>> slaver|have been nurturing withered away, leaving nothing
behind. All the efforts you've spent on the plant is completely wasted, and
<<rep $g.slaver>> slaver|look more dejected than usual. But at least <<they
$g.slaver>> slaver|is fine and uninjured, and you can always try again in the
future, should another chance present itself to you...
