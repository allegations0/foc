<<set _iter = $varstore.get('wanderer_joins_missing') || 0>>
<<set _u = setup.getAnySlaver([$g.wanderer])>>
<p>
Your usually <<uadj $g.wanderer>> <<rep $g.wanderer>> wanderer|is nowhere to be seen.
<<if _iter > 2>>
But you're not a little bit surprised by now â€” It has almost become a routine
that <<rep $g.wanderer>> must disappear from your fort every now and then.
<<if $fort.player.isHasBuilding(setup.buildingtemplate.mailroom)>>
Perhaps you can adjust your schedule to fit this variable in, or perhaps you
can try to find the root cause of <<their $g.wanderer>> frequent disappearances...
<<else>>
Perhaps once you build the <<rep setup.buildingtemplate.mailroom>>, you can
try to find the root cause of <<their $g.wanderer>> frequent disappearances.
But until then, you'll just have to adjust <<their $g.wanderer>> schedule
every now and then.
<</if>>
<<elseif _iter > 0>>
As you recall, this isn't the first time the mysterious slaver wanderer|have disappeared
from your fort. The last time <<they $g.wanderer>> disappeared, <<they
$g.wanderer>> dodged all of your questions asking where <<they $g.wanderer>>
had gone to. You're starting to think if you should dock the <<uadjper
$g.wanderer>> slaver's pay...
<<else>>
Even with <<yourrep _u>> helping
you comb the entire fort, there was no trace of <<rep $g.wanderer>> to be
found. Strange, you think to yourself, but perhaps <<theslaver $g.wanderer>> just wanderer|need some
time for <<themself $g.wanderer>>. <<They $g.wanderer>>'ll probably be back
by next week to collect <<their $g.wanderer>> pay as usual.
<</if>>
