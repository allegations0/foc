:: Event_worried_wolf [nobr]

<p>
Entering your office today, you are surprised to find <<yourrep $g.child>>
waiting anxiously for you inside. <<They $g.child>> child|has come to talk about your
company's recent quest in the
<<lore region_vale>>, where your slavers encountered a certain werewolf that bear
striking similarity to <<them $g.child>>.
</p>

<p>
For the first time ever, <<they $g.child>> child|tell you <<their $g.child>> full
backstory. As you recall, <<rep $g.child>> child|is the child of a werewolf
father and a human mother. But that's not the entire story â€” the mother was an innocent
villager until one day the village was attacked and burned to the ground by
a werewolf raiding party. In that fateful day, one of the more lusty werewolf
apparently raped the poor lady, impregnating her in the process. <<Rep
$g.child>> child|was the end result of that, and has been gathering
information about the evil werewolf, who is responsible for <<their $g.child>> cursed existence.
</p>

<p>
Seeing this as a potential lead, <<they $g.child>> child|ask you to send <<them
$g.child>> over should you receive a similar request in the future.
As <<they $g.child>> exited your office, you
ponder on <<their $g.child>> request before going on with the rest of your day.
</p>
