:: Event_teachings_of_obedience [nobr]
<p>
It's been almost three months after <<yourrep $g.slaver>> asked for a break
from <<their $g.slaver>> slaving duties, and you have not heard any wind from
<<therace $g.slaver>>. Out of concern, you've decided to enter <<their
$g.slaver>> room in the fort as quietly as you can.
</p>

<p>
Peeking through the gap in the door, you see your slaver apparently asleep on
<<their $g.slaver>> small desk, next to what appears to be a large tome. Not
wanting to disturb the slaver, you tiptoe and approach the desk, before sneaking
glance at the tome deftly titled the "Training of Obedience". The tome
details a wealth of knowledge on how to properly break a slave's will
permanently, but with proper care as not to damage the slave nor make them
snap.
<<if $g.slaver.isHasTrait('per_studious')>>
The book is written meticulously â€” as expected from your studious slaver,
which makes it very easy for you to read in its entirety.
<<elseif $g.slaver.isHasTrait('per_active')>>
While the writing is sloppy, the book's storytelling is very engaging, and
before long you've finished reading the entire tome.
<<else>>
The book's writing is great, and before you know it you've finished reading
the book.
<</if>>

</p>

<p>
Having finished reading the tome, you are surprised to find <<yourrep $g.slaver>>
smiling amusedly behind you, before thanking you for the break and offering
you the book as the result of their work. You can see <<theslaver $g.slaver>> beaming proudly
at the book, no doubt <<their $g.slaver>> magnum opus. You would too, if you
were to write such a well-written piece of work!
</p>
