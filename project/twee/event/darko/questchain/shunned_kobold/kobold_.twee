:: Event_kobold_ [nobr]
<p>
    <<Rep $g.kobold>> has changed remarkably since <<therace $g.kobold>> first joined you.
    You still remember when <<they $g.kobold>> were short and malnourished, as well as green and inexperienced.
    But looking at <<therace $g.kobold>> now, <<they $g.kobold>> looks much healthier now, as well as pretty tall, uncharacteristic for a kobold.
    <<if $g.kobold.isHasTrait('per_active')>>
        <<They $g.kobold>> enjoys the sunlight too, another strange trait.
    <</if>>
    <<if $g.kobold.isHasTrait('per_studious')>>
        <<They $g.kobold>> spends a lot of time in the library.
    <</if>>
    <<if $g.kobold.isHasTrait('per_direct')>>
        <<They $g.kobold>> doesn't really mince words, and usually go straight to the point now.
    <</if>>
    <<if $g.kobold.isHasTrait('per_sly')>>
        <<They $g.kobold>> is becoming sly and cunning too.
    <</if>>
    <<if $g.kobold.isHasTrait('per_frugal')>>
        Compared to before, <<rep $g.kobold>> is far more frugal now, saving <<their $g.kobold>> wage for who-knows-what.
    <</if>>
    <<if $g.kobold.isHasTrait('per_lavish')>>
        Compared to before, <<rep $g.kobold>> is more lavish now, sometimes spending a little but unnecessarily.
    <</if>>
    <<if $g.kobold.isHasTrait('per_loner')>>
        Compared to before, <<rep $g.kobold>> is a bit more aloof.
    <</if>>
    <<if $g.kobold.isHasTrait('per_gregarious')>>
        Compared to before, <<rep $g.kobold>> is much better at sweet-talking people, even you sometimes.
    <</if>>
    <<if $g.kobold.isHasTrait('per_playful')>>
        <<They $g.kobold>> has become rather playful too, and could be seen drinking the time away in the bar.
    <</if>>
    <<if $g.kobold.isHasTrait('per_serious')>>
        <<They $g.kobold>> usually can be seen with a serious face, although you're not sure what exactly is going on in <<their $g.kobold>> head.
    <</if>>
    <<if $g.kobold.isHasTrait('per_calm')>>
        <<They $g.kobold>> is usually very calm now.
    <</if>>
    <<if $g.kobold.isHasTrait('per_aggressive')>>
        <<They $g.kobold>> becomes a little brash too, and sometimes hurls particularly rude words to others.
    <</if>>
    <<if $g.kobold.isHasTrait('magic_fire') || $g.kobold.isHasTrait('magic_light')>>
        You can even sense strong magical energy radiating from the kobold.
    <</if>>
</p>

<p>
    Which makes you wonder... is <<rep $g.kobold>> really a kobold at all? <<They $g.kobold>> sure looks like one before, but now, <<they $g.kobold>> looks more dragonkin than kobold.
    And apparently, you're not the only one who thinks so too.
    A dragonkin envoy from <<rep $company.dragonkin>> is currently visiting your fort, before casually mistakingly greeting the passing <<rep $g.kobold>> as a fellow dragonkin.
    Judging from the large pause, it seems <<rep $g.kobold>> <<themself $g.kobold>> has been thinking about it too.
</p>

<p>
    Seeing how you have a real dragonkin in front of you, you tell the envoy the full story about <<rep $g.kobold>> â€” how the once diminutive kobold just somehow grow within a span of months.
    Could it be that <<rep $g.kobold>> is a dragonkin? But unfortunately, there really is no way to tell that, since tall kobolds do exists (albeit extremely rarely). But they suggested that somewhere within the <<lore region_deep>>, there is an artifact called the Mirror of Desires, who might be able to answer your as well as <<reps $g.kobold>> question...
