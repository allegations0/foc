<p>
In the recent days, <<yourrep $g.slaver>> occasionally act very strange around you and your slavers. When you greeted <<therace $g.slaver>>, for example, <<they $g.slaver>> instead just run away from you. Your other slavers often found <<therace $g.slaver>> skulking around in your fort too, seemingly trying to avoid attention although having the exact opposite effect. But on other occasions, <<therace $g.slaver>> is perfectly normal, and <<they $g.slaver>> can still often be found <<uhobbyverb $g.slaver>> in <<their $g.slaver>> free time.

But maybe you're just imagining things, since you've been working a little too hard, and maybe just need a couple of weeks of rest.
Still, you also recall hearing strange noises coming from somewhere in your fort during night,
but perhaps it is again due to you being too tired...
