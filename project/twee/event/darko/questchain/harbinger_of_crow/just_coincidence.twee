<p>
Today <<yourrep $g.a>> reported on duty drenched wet despite the clear sky. Apparently, <<they $g.a>> somehow happened to be in the wrong time and at the wrong place when a sudden, extremely concentrated shower just happened to drench <<therace $g.a>>, almost as if it was targeted specifically for <<them $g.a>>. Coupled with some other "coincidences" last week like how
<<if $g.a.getTail()>>
<<their $g.a>> tail got stuck between the door,
<<else>>
<<their $g.a>> clothes stuck between the door causing <<them $g.a>> to bang <<their $g.a>> heads against the wall,
<</if>>
it seems that <<rep $g.a>> might not have the strongest luck in the company...
