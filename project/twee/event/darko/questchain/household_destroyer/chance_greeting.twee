<<set _u = setup.getAnySlaver()>>
<p>
    <<Yourrep _u>> alerted you today that one of your slavers, <<rep $g.slaver>> had been noticably... sluttier of late.
    The cause was apparently a chance meeting with your resident drow guest, <<rep $g.drow>>, whom as you recall was the overly dominant drow that you had decided to host just outside of your fort.
</p>

<p>
    The damage has been done, and <<rep $g.slaver>> might be mistaken for a slave right now, but this might not be the end of your problems with the drow...
</p>
