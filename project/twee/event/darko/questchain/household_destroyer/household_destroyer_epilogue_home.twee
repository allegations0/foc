    It has been a few weeks since <<rep $g.drow>> had returned to <<their $g.drow>> city, "cured" of <<their $g.drow>> excessive dominance aura. Today, you receive a letter from the drow, likely a farewell for having hosted the drow before.

        Dear <<name $unit.player>>,
    </p>
    <p>
        I've returned to my people, after the long stay on the surface. They were initially suspicious about my return, but after no longer seeing random passerbies being "subbed", I am accepted back home. I'm starting to learn how to control this power of dominance, and I've taken up the lucrative job of a slave trainer here. The experience I got watching you doing your work sure helped a lot. As a gratitude, feel free to help yourself to any of the belongings I left behind in my room. I'm sure some of them will be to your liking.
    </p>

    <p>
        Goodbye,
    </p>
    <p>
        <<name $g.drow>>
    </p>

    Later, you found a single piece of underwear hidden in the drow's old homestead. What was once an ordinary underwear seemed to have been enchanted by being worn so many times by the dominant drow, and is now exerting great slaving powers. It is worthy of being called an artefact now, a worthy parting gift with the drow whom you will likely never see ever again.
