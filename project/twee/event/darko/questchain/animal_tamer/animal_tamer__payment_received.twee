<p>
A delivery had come to your fort today in the form of a very large box.
As <<yourrep _v>> helped you open the box, you noticed there were breathing
holes punched at the corners of the box, and you could guess what is inside.
Indeed, you
found <<yourrep _u>> in full bondage gear inside, having graduated from the animal
trainer's training. Upon closer inspection, the slave indeed no longer had
any of the defiant flame that used to burn so brightly in <<their _u>> eyes.
It seemed the trainer spoke truly â€” the slave has now been fully broken, and
<<their _u>> training to become a proper slave can finally begin in earnest.
