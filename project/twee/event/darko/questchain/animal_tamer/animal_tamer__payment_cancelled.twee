<p>
A delivery has come to your fort today in the form of a very large box.
As <<yourrep _v>> helps you open the box, you notice that there are breathing
holes in various corners of the box, which gives you a good guess of what is contained inside. Indeed, you
found <<yourrep _u>> in full bondage gear inside, apparently having finished training from the animal
trainer's training. It seems the animal trainer has decided to return the
slave to you.
However, you can see that the slave is still full-on defiant,
and remains unbroken â€” perhaps the animal trainer actually restores the
animal's spirit, seeing that you have never made the requisite payment...
Back to square one it is for you then.
