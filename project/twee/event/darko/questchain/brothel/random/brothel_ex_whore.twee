<p>
There are many people working in <<attach _describe>>, and not all of them are courtesans. There is of course <<yourrep $g.owner>>, who is responsible for managing the brothel. There are also the bouncers, including one of your former slave. And finally, there is <<name $g.head>>, a former whore who you have promoted as the brothel's
<<if _promotion == 'money'>>
business manager.
<<else>>
customer relations officer.
<</if>>
</p>

<p>
<<if _promotion == 'money'>>

As the business manager, the <<girl $g.head>> is almost always busily working in <<their $g.head>> office. <<They $g.head>> must ensure that resources are used within an appropriate limit, and also ensure that no expense went unrecorded. At the end of each day, <<name $g.head>> can often be seen working downstairs, ensuring that all the customer have paid for the services rendered.

<<else>>
As the customer relations officer, the <<girl $g.head>> is almost always seen working within the brothel. Whenever a customer looks unhappy, <<they $g.head>> approaches them, and tries <<their $g.head>> best to appease them. At the end of each day, <<name $g.head>> can usually be found near the entrance, bowing and thanking the customers for their patronage.
<</if>>
It's quite a busy life.
</p>

<<choose>>

<<opt "Give <<them $g.head>> a week of well-deserved vacation">>

<p>
The next day, you wait for <<them $g.head>> in <<their $g.head>> office, and give them an all-expenses-paid trip to the <<lore region_vale>>. When the diligent <<man $g.head>> tries to refuse, you insist, and eventually <<therace $g.head>> relents and agree to go on a vacation.
</p>

<p>
The vacation does wonder for the overworked <<name $g.head>>, and they never realize how jaded they had been up until the vacation. When <<they $g.head>> returns, <<they $g.head>> appears much more cheerful than before, and is able to work more efficiently than before. Your brothel's reputation increased slightly as a result.

<<opt "Enjoy some consensual sex with the hard-working <<man $g.head>>">>

<p>
When <<name $g.head>> head|return to <<their $g.head>> luxurious bedroom, <<they $g.head>> head|was surprised to find you lying on the bed naked. Taking the hint, <<they $g.head>> head|leap into the bed, and you slowly caress the overworked <<urace $g.head>>. You make out for a while under the sheets, before going raunchier and raunchier into the night. Neither of you get too much sleep that night, but despite that, in the next day <<name $g.head>> appears more refreshed and less jaded than ever.
