<<set _progress = $varstore.get('rival_blackmail_progress') || 0>>

<<if $varstore.get('rival_blackmail_active')>>
<p>
An emissary from the bastard rival slaving company that has come to your fort demanding
payment for your slaver's continued... ahem, "luxury accomodation" under their care. You
grudgingly pay the slaver,
<<if _progress >= 3>>
while sensing a desperation in the messenger's voice, no doubt thanks to your
efforts to crumble your rival' company so far...
<<elseif _progress >= 2>>
knowing full well that soon, retaliation is at hand...
<<elseif _progress >= 1>>
your current retaliation plan in the front of your mind...
<<else>>
while wondering if this will continue on forever...
<</if>>
</p>

<p>
The emissary promised to return again next month.
</p>

<<else>>
<<if $varstore.get('rival_blackmail_cancel')>>
  <p>
    You've made up your mind to not continue the monthly installments.
    The messenger will return empty-handed.
    But your former slaver's fate is now sealed...
  </p>
<<else>>
  <p>
  Having defeated your rival's company, the monthly "accomodation fee" you
  have been paying for your slaver's continued safety has finally ended. It
  feels good.
