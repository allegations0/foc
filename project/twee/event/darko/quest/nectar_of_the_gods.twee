<<if _t.length>>
<p>
The recent disappearance of <<yourrep _t[0]>> in the <<lore region_forest>>
is not the first time this has happened. As you recall, a mischievous fairy
was responsible for when it happened last time, and you've no doubt this is
done by yet another mischivious fairy.
</p>
<</if>>

<p>
You're not the only one who has connected the dots. As you ponder on the
idea, <<yourrep $g.slaver>> slaver|come to your office, bringing good news.
Apparently, <<they $g.slaver>> slaver|have found a potential lead on how to
possibly get back on that fairy â€” it all begins with finding a rare and
exotic <<rep setup.item.quest_bewitchment_nectar>> somewhere in the <<lore
region_sea>>. It is said that fairies cannot resist the allure of this rare
nectar, and you might just be able to use this to your advantage.
</p>

<p>
Getting a nectar is probably sufficient to get back at the fairy in some way.
However, if your vindictiveness goes beyond normal, it might also be possible
to combine the nectar with a specifically-designed trap from a famous
rat-catcher in the <<lore region_city>>. After all, fairies are pretty much
flying rats, so this should work well. There is no doubt getting the trap
will be difficult however, considering that the rat-catcher is an infamous
lunatic, and will demand absurd things in exchange for the services
rendered...
</p>

<p>
Then again, it might just be as wise to simply rescue your lost slavers, if
you so choose...
