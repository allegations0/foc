:: Event_defiant_slave [nobr]

<p>
After a few days, it becomes clear that your newly acquired slave, <<rep
$g.slave>>, slave|is rather special. Unlike most of your other slaves, <<they
$g.slave>> slave|is not reduced to begging and crying after the first few
training sessions, and still remains as defiant as ever. It seems the usual
training regime you have for your normal slaves will not work for this
particularly strong-willed <<urace $g.slave>>.
</p>

<p>
Thankfully, <<yourrep $g.slaver>> slaver|have came up with a plan, which
<<they $g.slaver>> slaver|hands over to you in the form of <<rep
setup.item.technology_research>>. Reading the plan, you would first have to
build the <<rep setup.buildingtemplate.researchroom>>. Having that built, you
can then assign a few of your slavers to research <<yourrep $g.slave>>,
figuring out how to break the resistant slave, possibly with outside help. It
should not be too hard to find such ways, but there is no doubt that each
would require extreme measures and will be very difficult to actually
complete.
<<if $unit.player.isHasTrait('per_dominant')>>
You can't help but let out a dominant grin as you imagine the once resistant
slave being broken to the point of compliance.
<<elseif $unit.player.isHasTrait('per_submissive')>>
Your submissive mind starts to conjure various images of you being put in the
slave's no doubt extensive training, but realizing that <<rep $g.slaver>>
slaver|is still in the room you quickly shoo the thoughts away.
<</if>>
</p>

<p>
You thank <<yourrep $g.slaver>> before sitting on your desk alone with the
<<rep setup.item.technology_research>> on your desk, staring back at you.
</p>
