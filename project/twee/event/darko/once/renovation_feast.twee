:: Event_renovation_feast [nobr]
<p>
This week, you have built the
<<rep setup.buildingtemplate.greathall>> of your fort. The fort is starting
to feel like home now, with all the basic improvements required for a slaving
career finally fully built.
You decide to do a little tour of the fort for today.
</p>

<p>
You find <<yourrep $g.slaver1>> <<uadv $g.slaver1>> snoozing away in the <<rep
setup.buildingtemplate.lodgings>> area, on a comfortable bed this time rather
than outside in the rain.
Exiting the lodging area, you arrive at an open space designated as the
<<rep setup.buildingtemplate.hiringsquare>>, where you can hire new slavers
into your fort, who will then go into the <<rep
setup.buildingtemplate.prospectshall>>. Next is the newly built <<rep
setup.buildingtemplate.greathall>> — a wide open space where you can gather
your slavers for important occassions and celebrations. It is empty right now, save for <<yourrep
$g.slaver2>> who slaver2|is busy <<uadv $g.slaver2>> arguing with <<rep $g.slaver3>>.
</p>

<p>
Not wanting to get into their argument, you enter the work area of your fort: a series of
office rooms to sort out the various paperwork that will surely become your daily
business. The incoming mails are received in the <<rep
setup.buildingtemplate.mailroom>>, which is next to your main office. A
separate room has been designated as the <<rep
setup.buildingtemplate.marketingoffice>>, where you can arrange slaves to be
pawned for money.
</p>

<p>
Finally, you descend into the basements of your fort. While initially it was
full of rubble, they have been mostly cleared up and part of the basement has
been turned into a dungeons complex. Here, you can keep your slaves either to sell
them later, or for your own and your slavers' amusement. Who knows, maybe one
day you'll be able to afford the <<rep setup.buildingtemplate.bedchamberwing>>
and keep a harem for your own. Newly gathered slaves will be placed in the
<<rep setup.buildingtemplate.slavepens>> just outside your fort.
</p>

<p>
Your fellow slaver, <<rep $g.slaver4>>, <<uadv $g.slaver4>> slaver4|greet you, and
slaver4|express <<their $g.slaver4>> appreciation for all your work leading the group so
far. The team indeed feels a little more like family now. Still, there are
more work to be done. Perhaps you can aim to renovate the empty space above
your <<rep setup.buildingtemplate.greathall>> — a <<rep
setup.buildingtemplate.veteranhall>> would surely be a nice addition to your
fort.
</p>

<p>
Later, you find a <<rep setup.item.sexmanual_sit>> sitting on your desk
wrapped nicely with a bow.
A "thank you" card was attached on top of it, and judging from the
<<if $g.slaver4.isHasTrait('per_studious')>>
beautiful
<<elseif $g.slaver4.isHasTrait('per_active')>>
horrible
<<else>>
decent
<</if>>
handwriting you can only guess
that <<yourrep $g.slaver4>> must have written it. It seems that all your slavers have decided to pool a little bit
of their
<<if $settings.challengemode>>
  outrageously large
<<else>>
  modest
<</if>>
wage and get you a little present for the achievement.
</p>
