<p>
Today, you've received an extremely well-written letter in your mailbox.
</p>

<div class='lettercard'>
<p>
Esteemed <<name $unit.player>> of <<rep $company.player>>,
</p>

<p>
My name is <<name $g.slave>>, or so my <<master $g.master>> has named me. It
has come to the attention of my <<master $g.master>>, <<lord $g.master>> <<name $g.master>>,
that you have acquired a particularly rare slave â€” a
defiant specimen that would not break from even the harshest trainings. My
<<master $g.master>> delights in breaking such hardy slaves, as I was once,
and would make a generous offer should you wish to sell the slave to <<them
$g.master>>. If you are interested in this offer, please seek my <<master
$g.master>> out in the <<lore region_sea>>.
</p>
<p>
Your most humble slave,<br/>
<<name $g.slave>>
</p>
</div>

<p>
An interesting offer. It seems if you are tired of breaking your defiant slaves, there is demand for these specimens somewhere in the <<lore region_sea>>. You could try to scout the area should you wish to follow-up on this offer.
</p>
