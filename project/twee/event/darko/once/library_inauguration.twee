<p>
Your fort finally has a proper <<rep setup.buildingtemplate.library>> now.
The grand structure costs you quite a fortune, but you have no doubt it will
be very useful for you and your career.
The bookshelves are lined up neatly with books of various origins, be it
detailing the various lores of this region, or explaining how magic works in
the world.

<<Yourrep $g.slaver>> slaver|is here too, seemingly busy reading a book. But
something is off about the book <<theslaver $g.slaver>> slaver|is reading â€” it is too colorful,
and lacking texts, compared to most other books here. Instead it looks like...
picture book? As you approach closer, <<theslaver $g.slaver>> slaver|notice you and

<<if $g.slaver.isHasTrait('per_chaste')>>
immediately close the book and straightened up <<their $g.slaver>> posture,
as if hiding something embarrassing...

<<else>>
slaver|give you a wily smile before continuing drooling over the book.

<</if>>

Sensing something incredibly wrong, you sneak up behind <<theslaver $g.slaver>> and are greeted
by explicit images of a <<man $g.gender>> engaging in sex in a rather
auspicious position. Surprised by your sudden appearance, <<rep $g.slaver>>
accidentally slaver|drop the book to the floor, which you then pick up and identify as the <<rep
setup.item.sexmanual_sixtynine>>. Glaring daggers at your slaver, you wonder
if this is the reason why the library was so expensive to build...
