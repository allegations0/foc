<p>
Some culture in the faraway land beyond the <<lore region_sea>> consider sex
as a form of art. They have developed numerous sex techniques to support this, the
infamous of them being their teasing techniques. Even when
fully clothed, you can never know when one of these people would suddenly
approach you, and tease
<<if $unit.player.isHasDick()>>
your dick over their asses,
<<else>>
their dick over your pussy,
<</if>>
forcing an
<<if $unit.player.isHasDick()>>
erection
<<else>>
arousal
<</if>>.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to your incredible relationship with the <<rep $company.humansea>>,
however, now you are in possession of the rare and ancient tome: the <<rep
setup.item.sexmanual_tease>>. From inside the book you can sense unimaginable
power â€” the power of teasing genitals without actually doing the penetration.
You can already imagine the many uses of such knowledge, and frankly
speaking, you can't wait to try it out. Grinning to yourself, you decide to
visit
<<set _l = $unit.player.getLover()>>
<<if _l>>
your lover <<rep _l>> later during work for some mid-work teasing.
<<else>>
your dungeons later for some fun.
<</if>>
