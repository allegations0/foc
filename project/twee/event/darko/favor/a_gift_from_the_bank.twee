<p>
Through a series of appropriately placed bribes and investments, your
standings with the <<rep $company.bank>> has grown. They have trusted your
company a great deal now, and in fact, an emissary has just arrived at your fort today to seal
the alliance with a gift.
A proper gift for a person such as you, the <<rep setup.item.sexmanual_lick_feet>>.
</p>

<p>
The book details many sexual pleasures one could derive from getting their
feet worshipped and licked clean. While the book itself is certainly a
valuable gift, you can't feel but notice that the neko messenger smirks a
little at the gift â€” a bootlicker for a bootlicker perhaps? Either way, this
is a valuable gift, and you grudgingly thank the messenger before putting
the book in your shelf for later perusal.
</p>

<p>
You can see <<yourrep _u>> smirking at you for receiving such a gift and for the connotation it
brings. You make a mental note to put the <<uadjgood _u>> <<urace _u>> in a
dangerous mission later this week.
