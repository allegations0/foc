<p>
    An emissary from the glorious city of <<rep $company.drow>> has ascended to the surface and into your fort, apparently, bringing a gift.
    Knowing drow politics, you exercise extreme caution receiving the gift, knowing all too well that the drows never give out anything for free.
    The gift turns out to be a pretty rare sex manual. Unlike most other companies, the drow did not dignify you with a demonstration, but given the content of the book, that's probably a good thing.

<p>
    The book, the <<rep setup.item.sexmanual_step_on_dick>> describes how to assert a slave's place by stepping on their very manhood. A fitting gift, given how cruel drow culture could be. But you get the feeling this might just be a thinly veiled threat that you should never go against the drows...
