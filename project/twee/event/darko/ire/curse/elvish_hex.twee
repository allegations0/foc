<p>
Your slavers don't spend all their free time inside the fort.
Sometimes, they would go out into the nearby taverns to enjoy something else other than slave sex and
peruse the local selection of wares.
They usually return to your fort with nothing but smile on their face, but sometimes, they would also get something else during the r&r.
</p>

<p>
Yesterday, some of your slavers returned from those taverns and bragged about how they had
been blessed by a
<<if $g.elf.isMale()>>
ruggedly handsome
<<else>>
exotically beautiful
<</if>>
elven priest they just so happen to find in the tavern while being quite drunk.
You raised an eyebrow on this, of course, since there was so many things wrong with the story.
What's an elven priest doing in the vales, far from their home?
A priest going into the taverns?
And why would they bless your slavers known for their depravities?
</p>

<p>
Your questions are answered today, as instead of a blessing, it seems that your slavers
were bestowed by a terrible curse instead. Throughout the day, they would find themself in strange
precarious situations. It seems that instead of a blessing, your slavers were bestowed with
an elven hex instead. Come to think of it, you did anger some factions among the
<<rep $company.elf>> recently, and perhaps this is their way of showing their "gratitude"
for all you've done...
