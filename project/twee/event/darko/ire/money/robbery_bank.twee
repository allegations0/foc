<p>
Your slavers wake up today with a light feeling in their pockets. Literally,
this time, as somehow a huge sum of money has went missing from your coffers.
While you would normally suspect one of your slavers to spend too much on a
drunken night (especially that <<uadjbad $g.slaver>> <<urace $g.slaver>>
slaver of yours <<rep $g.slaver>>), the sum is simply too much to be spent by
one <<man $g.slaver>> alone.
</p>

<p>
A few days later, you receive a thank you letter coming from the <<rep
$company.bank>> for your investment in the bank. If you had doubts before, it
is gone now â€” the bank has stolen from you as recompense for the troubles you
may have caused them in the past. As much as you wanted revenge, it is better
to give up the plan, especially against an entity as rich as the <<rep
$company.bank>>. At least this should even out the goodwill, eh?
</p>
