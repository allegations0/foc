<p>
As you are doing the daily accounting for your money, you notice a large sum
has recently went missing. Upon further scrutiny, it seems that your company
has made a very bad purchase some time in an eastern city. Apparently <<yourrep
$g.slaver>> slaver|was swindled by an unscrupulous merchant from the east,
losing much of your money. The <<uadjbad $g.slaver2>> slaver <<rep
$g.slaver2>> slaver2|was also swindled, and probably many more of your slavers.
</p>

<p>
In fact, talking to the rest of the fort reveals that almost everyone
seemingly have been swindled by a merchant or two in the recent days. Perhaps
this is their way of showing their displeasure at your company from your
deeds in the past. You consider being more careful in the future, and to avoid
making these people as your enemy, but in the meantime you can always channel your
frustration into one of your slaves.
