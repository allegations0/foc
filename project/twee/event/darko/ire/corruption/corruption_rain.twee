:: Event_corruption_rain [nobr]

<p>
As you were going by your usual business, the sky above your fort (and only
above your fort) suddenly turns pitch black. A black magical circle appears
on the sky, raining dark spells down your fort.
Your slavers and slaves frantically try to dodge as many of the dark bullets
as possible, which seemingly deal no damage to the structure but rapidly
alter any flesh unlucky enough to be touched by the corruption.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, the spell fizzles leaving the sky bright once again. But the
damage has been done, as several of your slavers and slaves who are currently at home
become noticably corrupted.
</p>

<p>
Only powerful beings can possibly cast such a dangerous spell. Given the
amount of dark energy though, this must be the work of the <<rep
$company.demon>>, whom you have angered recently.
</p>
