<p>
In the recent months, you have somehow made enemies with the local brigand
gang. And today, you reap the consequences as <<yourrep $g.slaver>> reports
that <<yourrep $g.victim>> victim|is nowhere to be seen. Searching through the
entire fort, from their room to the empty dungeon cells yields nothing, as
if <<rep $g.victim>> victim|have just vanished into thin air. That is, until you see
the news that <<rep $g.victim>> victim|is going to be auctioned soon in the
undercity of Lucgate.
</p>

<p>
It is unfortunately already too late for you to participate in the auction,
but from what you have gathered, this is the work of that <<rep $company.outlaws>>
that you have irked recently. But there is no time to think about that â€”
<<uneedrescue $g.victim>>.
