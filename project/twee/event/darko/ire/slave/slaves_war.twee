:: Event_slaves_war [nobr]
<p>
Recently, your company's actions have undermined the general <<rep $company.outlaws>> society â€”
In particular, you have made enemies with one particular outlawed slaving
company in the past few weeks. In a brazen retaliation, they have
kidnapped one of your slavers, <<yourrep $g.victim>>, straight from your
fort. You have a mind to scold <<rep $g.slaver>> for allowing such a
brazen kidnapping to happen, but on the other hand you should probably spend
your time thinking how to get the slave back, if you wish.
<<uneedrescue $g.victim>>.
