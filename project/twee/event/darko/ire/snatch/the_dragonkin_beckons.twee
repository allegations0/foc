<p>
The sun shines brightly today, and just as you thought the day is perfect for once,
a sudden chill freezes the entire compound. Paralyzed from an unknown force, you
cannot do anything but watch as a majestic blue-colored dragonkin descends
from the sky and into your compound. <<They $g.dragon>> calmly walks around your
compound as if nothing has happenned, inspecting some of your slavers until settling
at <<yourrep $g.victim>>. "You will do," the dragonkin says calmly as <<they $g.dragon>>
takes <<rep $g.victim>> and carries <<them $g.victim>> effortlessly back to
the sky.
</p>

<p>
Whatever paralyzes you and your slavers dissipate soon after. After catching
your breath, you look to the sky wondering if this was a retribution for your
actions against the <<rep $company.dragonkin>>. You shrug it all off, and
start planning your next move. <<urescuenow $g.victim>>, although it sure as
hell won't be easy.
