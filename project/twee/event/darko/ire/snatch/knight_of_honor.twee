:: Event_knight_of_honor [nobr]

<p>
<<Rep $g.victim>> would often to go the surrounding taverns, be it to engage in a drunken
brawl, or simply to waste the time away.
But <<they $g.victim>> always come back to the fort one day or two after.
Not this time, however, and after the fourth day you're starting to suspect that something went horribly wrong.
</p>

<p>
Going to the tavern yourself and asking the wenches, you've learned that a challenger
has challenged <<therace $g.victim>> to a duel.
<<if $g.victim.isHasTrait('per_cautious')>>
The cautious fool refuses, of course, but one way or another your slaver departed together
with the challenger from the tavern.
<<elseif $g.victim.isHasTrait('per_brave')>>
The brave fool accepted, of course, and departed with the challenger from the tavern.
<<else>>
After the promise of money, your slaver accepted and departed the tavern together with the challenger.
<</if>>
When you press a little harder, the wench indicated something was completely off
about the challenger -- the manner of speaking was too high classed,
the posture too proud, and most importantly she could hear the clink of armor or two
underneath.
</p>

<p>
It seemed that a knight, no doubt sent by someone within the <<rep $company.royal>>,
has come to retaliate against your recent actions by kidnapping one of your trusted slavers.
You sighed to yourself, and reminds yourself not to mess with the <<rep $company.royal>>
too much. But that's been done, and you'll just have to rescue <<rep $g.victim>> now, although
it sure as hell won't be easy.
</p>
