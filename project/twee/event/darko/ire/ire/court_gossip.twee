:: Event_court_gossip [nobr]

<p>
Recently, you have somehow made crucial enemies within the vindictive <<rep $company.royal>> of the
<<rep $company.humankingdom>>.
In particular, many ladies there is starting to show disdain towards your company.
Given your slavery background, it would not do for these ladies should their connections
towards you be well known, and hence they resorted to something they are incredibly familiar with
to undermine your company: gossips.
Within days, gossips spread very fast about the multiple inadequacies of your company,
and before long many other companies starting to view your company with much less respect than before...
</p>

<p>
Perhaps it would be a sound advice not to make enemies of these women, but what is done is done.
