:: Event_disappearing_act [nobr]

<p>
Today, you woke up with the news that one of your slaves,
<<rep $g.victim>>, has escaped from your fort.
Or so you thought.
Looking around the cell, you clearly noticed that something, or someone,
opened the lock from the outside.
</p>

<p>
After rounding up your slavers in fort and questioning them,
you feel reasonably confident that none of them were the culprit.
This leave only the possibility that an outside intruder has infiltrated your
fort and stole a particularly valuable slave under your care.
Looking at your list of "potential enemies", the most likely culprit
has to be those sneaky drows, who has no trouble whatsoever blending in with
the darkness and sneak into your dungeons.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps this is the result of your recent actions that may have angered the drows.
In either case, it is too late for regret, and should you wish to see <<rep $g.victim>>
return to your dungeons, you should act fast and now.
</p>
