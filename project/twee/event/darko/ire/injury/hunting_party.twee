:: Event_hunting_party [nobr]
<p>
During a tavern break, a group of your slavers were ambushed by a werewolf hunting party.
They appear to carry some kind of grudge against your company, perhaps due to your recent
actions against the <<rep $company.werewolf>>. Your slavers managed to barely escape,
while sustaining heavy injuries in the process.
</p>

<p>
There is nothing else you could do for now other than try to nurse their injuries as best as you could. 
You make a mental note to teach these pups a lesson one day -- your kennel could always use
more pets.
</p>
