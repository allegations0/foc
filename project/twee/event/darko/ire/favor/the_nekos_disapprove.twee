<p>
Your company has been a good friend to the <<rep $company.neko>>, the
sexually driven cats. But you have angered some high-class citizens of the
<<lore location_npc>> recently, and using their power, they have boycotted your
company from the city. As a result, your relationship with the neko suffer
greatly. Perhaps you should not have irked the cats too much.
