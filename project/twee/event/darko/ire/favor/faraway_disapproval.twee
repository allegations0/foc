<p>
Despite the long distance, your company has somehow maintain a positive
relationship with the <<rep $company.humansea>>. But recent events have
painted your company in a much worse light for them, and apparently they have
enough of it. In the coming days, you receive much less communication from
these elusive people. It seems they have decided to sever connections with
your company as the result of your recent actions.
