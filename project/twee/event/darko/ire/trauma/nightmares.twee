:: Event_nightmares [nobr]
<p>
In the recent weeks, you and some other slavers have started to experience
more and more haunting nightmares. While initially it started innocuously
such as dreams of falling into an endless pit, lately the nightmares have become more
intrusive. At one point you dreamt of being held in front of a succubus, being
forced to watch as your <<uadjgood $g.slaver>> <<urace $g.slaver>> slaver
<<rep $g.slaver>> slaver|was sexually tortured in front of you.
</p>

<p>
The experience has deeply traumatized some inhabitants of the fort. You are
certain this is the work of some other companies out there, perhaps as a
result of you angering the <<rep $company.demon>> recently.
