down <<= _victim.getName()>>'s throat ---
with <<= _victim.getName()>>'s <<uhead _victim>> between

Not wanting to lose out the action, you ask <<= _u.getName()>> to continue while sitting

You proceed to manhandle <<if !_hasdick>>the cruelly large phallus<<else>>your <<udick $unit.player>><</if>>
into place.
<<They _victim>> gives a strangled squeal of protest at the feeling of you pushing your way

You and <<= _u.getName()>> continues for twenty minutes
<<if $unit.player.getLover() == _u>>
  (interpersed with lovemaking between the two of you)
<</if>>
before leaving
the slave quiescent on the $i.floor of the $i.room.
After <<= _u.getName()>> locked the $i.room door back,

<<else>>
  <<uadv _u>> gave you a high-five.
