<p>
The successful scouting of the Milk Bar has given your company valuable
information. One information tells you that the security level of the bar and its
surroundings is way too high to perform a robbery without paying someone from
inside to literally open all the doors in the building for you. Judging
for the level of opulence of the place, the bribe would be way too expensive to make
the operation not profitable.
</p>

<p>
On the other side, you also found out about something with more
potential: a caravan is about to arrive at the oasis in a few weeks, carrying
the most recent shipment of prospects for new employees. Of course, given the
peculiarities of the butlers and maids of the bar, these slaves will have
certain assets that would snatch you a high price in the market.
With this limited but valuable information, it's up to you to choose what to
do: an assault to the caravan could get the company some rather huge and
voluptuous "merchandise", but the mission is definitely a dangerous one,
and messing with a rich group like this could certainly bring down some retribution
later down the road. Alternatively, you can play it safe
and take the slave order from The Milk Bar.
The order would no doubt be asking for slaves with certain "assets", but
the bar would appreciate this so much and are willing to pay very well for these slaves.
