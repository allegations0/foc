<p>
After opening the letter, you see the same handwriting as before, the one that were
asking you to cure <<yourrep $g.slave>>'s mind. But this time, you can
notice the enthusiasm of the sender in the text. They were profoundly grateful
to you for bringing <<rep $g.slave>>'s mind back, and was extremely excited to meet <<them $g.slave>>
in person so they could talk with <<them $g.slave>>.
It seemed weird that, considering your
line of work, someone was willing to rent a slave just to talk with them, but
the mysterious person had something more shameless in mind: this time, their
petition was that you would free <<yourrep $g.slave>> so <<they $g.slave>> could
finally get back to <<their $g.slave>> people.
Sheer force of will prevented you from tearing apart the letter in
that instant, and after pressing your fingers against your forehead in an
attempt to calm yourself, the next lines explained the possible benefits for
<<rep $company.player>>.
More people of the woods will appreciate you doing such a good deed,
and this brings many benefits,
including the possibility of acquiring high quality
equipment that would be otherwise impossible to find anywhere else. Angry
but at the same time intrigued for the audacity of the persona behind such
requests, maybe there was something in it for you should you decide to follow through with
this outrageous request...
</p>

<p>
On one hand, releasing a slave that you have just found, for whom you had
spent so many resources for sounds entirely crazy.
But an opportunity like this could be equally as valuable, just in a
different way. On the other hand, maybe it was better to forget all of this,
to quit while you are ahead and maybe even appreciate the benefits of having
<<rep $g.slave>> between your ranks.
</p>

<<else>>

<p>
The old neko got his whiskers back in your
business and had found out of the success of your treatment for <<rep $g.slave>> and,
just like before, wanted you to consider the option of freeing <<them $g.slave>> just so
<<they $g.slave>> could share <<their $g.slave>> knowledge (and questionable abilities) with the
rest of the world. The rewards for it were the same as before: favor with the
neko tribes of the region, which includes the ability to obtain a piece of high quality equipment
that would be almost impossible to find anywhere else. On a second thought, it
was pretty weird that such a “poor and secluded” village had items so
valuable in such quantities to give them away in exchange for this kind of
favors, but maybe it was better to follow the common wisdom of “the curiosity
killed the neko” and not ask too many questions.
</p>

<p>
Of course, if what the old man offered was not up to par with the quality of
the slave that you were going to lose in the trade, or if you already have a
particular plan for <<rep $g.slave>>, then you could always write him a letter thanking
him for his continuous (and creepy) interest in your company, but rejecting
his offer this time. He may get a little sad, but his mood will surely improve the
moment he hears you freed another petrified neko and will surely write to you
again.
</p>

Release the slave

<<if !$varstore.get('quest_furging_a_new_path_completed')>>

<p>
Against your better judgement, you decided to follow the instructions of an
anonymous letter and found yourself taking <<yourrep $g.slave>> through the forest
towards the famous village described in the letter.
You asked for the help of <<yourrep $g.slaver>> to escort you
while you guide the shackled <<urace $g.slave>> between the swaying trees and brambles.
A pair of extra eyes and <<uhands $g.slaver>> would help a lot should the slave
try to escape during the journey or, in the worst case, were you to be ambushed by your hosts.
If something like that were to happen, your slavers back in the fort have very
detailed instructions about what to do with the bastards that dared set up a
trap for you.
</p>

<p>
Surprisingly, the trip ended without any problems, and your small group found a
small and rudimentary village in the depths of the forest. All the inhabitants
of the place were neko that looked at you with great interest while you walk
between the huts, asking for the chieftain that had invited you. After
several whispers and looks of mistrust, a couple of them went and call for the chief.
When you finally saw eye-to-eye with the mysterious mailer, several things made sense. The chief
was a very, very old neko, so much that it surprised you he could still move on
his own, and his features and body were very similar to <<reps $g.slave>>, revealing
that, among every other inhabitants of the village, he had the strongest
connection with his tigerkin ancestors. The old man was happy to see you and
invited your group into his home. There, you both started to talk about the
deals that were made regarding freeing <<rep $g.slave>>, and you managed to come to
an agreement that seemed much fairer to you.
</p>

<p>
The old man promised to spread good words about your company to all the other
neko village and towns that he had connections with, spreading word about your generosity and support
towards his people. This could open up new business opportunities for your company.
Of course, he understood you may not trust him on his words, and arranged for a way
to let you keep track of his progress, that could prove that
he will be fulfilling his part of the deal.
<<if $g.slave.isHasTrait('subrace_tigerkin')>>
Even more, given your huge contribution, he presented to you a wooden box, within which
you found a high-quality robe, the kind of which you had never seen before.
At first glance the robe looked really expensive, and you were
sure that it would be very useful to your slavers 
should they ever need to dress themselves elegantly. But the moment you laid your finger on it,
you felt a powerful aura exuding from its threads: looked like it was magical too. Maybe all this
was worth it after all.
<</if>>
And since you now know the
location of this small village filled with defenseless neko, there is always the
possibility of taking a couple of “honored guests” to your fort, just in case he decided not keep his
words.
</p>

<p>
After releasing <<rep $g.slave>> from <<their $g.slave>> shackles, the townsfolks gave
new clothes to the <<urace $g.slave>> and invited <<them $g.slave>> to dine with them. The old man
invited you and <<yourrep $g.slaver>> too, but <<rep $g.slaver>> rejected his offer, given that
it would be quite awkward to sit at the same table with the former slave after
everything you made them “eat”
<<if !$settings.bannedtags.watersport>>
and "drink"
<</if>>
under your care. You bid farewell to the chieftain and
set out back to the fort, but not before explaining to the old man how a mail
room works so you can avoid getting more letters sneaked into your office.
</p>

<<else>>

<p>
Like last time, you decided to take the deal the old man offered you.
You handed him <<yourrep $g.slave>> so <<they $g.slave>> can be free,
to live together with the rest of <<their $g.slave>> people. This
time, you invited the chieftain to your fort so you can settle in the details
of the deal and at the same time save up the costs of having to transport the
former-slave to the confines of the <<lore region_forest>>.
</p>

<p>
A couple of days later, the old man showed up, accompanied by a couple of
young neko, who were all very curious about your employees and their jobs,
both the slavers and the slaves. After inviting him to
your office and talking for a bit, you managed to close the deal and <<yourrep $g.slave>> was
free to go with them. You tried to tempt your guests to use some of your
“facilities” and maybe get juicy information or even some blackmail material,
but the old cat was savvier than he looks and turned down your offer. You
and <<yourrep $g.slaver>> bid farewell to the group before noting down what you just got
out of the trade:
</p>

<<if !$g.slave.isHasTrait('subrace_tigerkin')>>

<p>
...Support from the old man's village to help you improve your reputation
with the groups of neko living in the forest.
This will surely help your company in your future endeavors.
</p>

<<else>>

<p>
...Improvement of the reputation of <<rep $company.player>> with the
different tribes and small towns of neko that live in the forest, and even
better, a magical ancient robe that only the old man and his village have
access to, for some weird and disturbing reason.
</p>

<p>
There is no way you'd turn <<yourrep $g.slave>> over.
You have grand plans for <<therace $g.slave>> after all, and you began
by teaching the slave <<their $g.slave>> appropriate place -- between your
legs and servicing your <<ugenital $unit.player>>.
