<p>
The letter comes from a small neko village in the <<lore region_forest>>, and the
apparently it is their leader who sent the letter. The next paragraph is full of
information about their culture, traditions and other useless details that
almost makes you want to throw away the letter and continue with your work,
but just before you do, a line catches your attention.
</p>

<p>
Apparently, this small
and recondite village somehow found out about one of your latest missions,
where you freed an ancient <<urace $g.neko>>
by breaking the spell that kept them as a living statue.
This group of neko has great interest in their ancestors, the
tigerkins, and also on the war between the elves and the neko from centuries ago.
Thanks to their obsession, they believe
that someone who had lived in those ancient times can be an incredible source of
information and wisdom. Unfortunately (and concerningly for you), they also know
about <<their $g.neko>> current mental state after being trapped for so long within the statue.
</p>

<p>
However, the neko are quite resourceful, and they are fully aware that
the elves have potions and rituals that could possibly recover a mind no matter how terribly lost
it was.
That's why they are asking, if possible, that you use your resources
to give <<rep $g.neko>> <<their $g.neko>> sanity back, and nothing else.
Whatever you decide to do with the slave afterwards,
just the knowledge that 
one of their ancestors has regained their mind would be enough to cheer up all
the villagers there.
</p>

<p>
All this seems really strange. They want you to heal your slave, and no
matter what you do with <<them $g.neko>> afterwards, they'll be thankful to you?
Sounds incredibly suspicious,
especially when you read that because they are such a “small and poor”
village, they can't pay you for it. Of course...
</p>

<p>
Well, you can do what they asked of you and restore <<yourrep $g.neko>>'s mind,
if you have or willing to gather the facilities and materials to do so.
Maybe this will net you some favor with the neko.
Or, you could simply ignore the letter and use
your new slave as the brainless sexdoll it currently is.
After all, not healing <<them $g.neko>> now doesn't mean you can't heal <<them $g.neko>> 
in the future, if you consider it necessary.
And what slaving company worth their name does charity
work without the possibility of a juicy reward?
</p>

<p>
Either way, it might be your best interest to start
<<successtext "building your relationship with the">> <<rep $company.elf>>.
</p>

<<else>>

<p>
The terms are just as last time: you
restore the mind of your new furry “employee” and he will spread much good word about
your company with his people and the neighboring villages, improving your reputation
with the neko of the area and opening new possibilities of juicy deals in
the future. And considering the costs of the treatment, he better speaks
wonders about you with them.
</p>

<p>
Of course, you can always ignore his request, and while you are sure
he will be a little disappointed by your rejection, he'll get over it as soon
as he finds out that you freed another one of kind again. It makes
you wonder, though, why he wants so many old neko soldiers loose around the village,
and you still ignore how he knows whenever you release one of them…

You crumple up the paper and throw it outside. Sweet words and pretty
envelopes aren't enough to convince you to spend resources without the chance
of getting something good in return. While the person writing the
letter may have good intentions, your company simply cannot survive on “good intentions”
alone. You get back to work with the pile of papers that are mounting in front of you and soon
enough, you forget everything related to that mysterious letter.
