<div class='lettercard'>
<p>
Honored <b>Guardian</b> of an Esteemed Student of Light,
</p>

<p>
It has come to our attention that a ward of yours, <<rep $g.pupil>>, has
passed through the first two
Gates of Enlightenment. While "her" wits and diligence have brought the Enlightenment
of the Mind and the Enlightenment of the Heart, the final part, 
Enlightenment of the Soul, is unofortunately out of reach for "her" and "her"
unique biology.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Biology? Did the master...
</p>

<div class='lettercard'>

<p>
While we have appreciated greatly "her", or should we say his diligence and
dedication for the Light, the final step is simply not possible for a man,
no matter how prettily disguised he is.
</p>

</div>

<p>
...The master knew about this all the time. What happens now? Does that mean you've been paying
all those tuition for nothing?
</p>

<div class='lettercard'>
<p>
Now I know what you think, if we know about the ward's gender, we should have refused the student
from the start. But alas, his dedication to the craft blinded us all, and we were unable to muster
the courage to expel the student.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, we have a solution should you wish to advance the mastery.
</p>
</div>

<p>
You scowl your face, knowing what's coming next.
</p>

<div class='lettercard'>
<p>
A meager sum of <<money 50000>> should be enough to buy one of our spellbooks,
which could grant the tutee the knowledge they seek...
</p>
</div>

<p>
You almost want to throw the letter outside of your window, but this could be <<reps $g.pupil>>
only chance to master <<rep setup.trait.magic_light_master>>...
</p>

Pay the outrageous fee


:: Opportunity_infiltration_of_the_soul___prelude_0_flavor [nobr]

<p>
Sighing to yourself, you pay the outrageous fee and receive the book.
If only your slaver should just blow somebody and get the damn spellbook...
</p>

<p>
It only took <<yourrep $g.pupil>> a day to master the craft by using the spellbook.
You are unsuer if this was the fruit of <<their $g.pupil>> previous classes,
or whether the book was all that was needed to master the craft...
</p>

Delay answering by a year.


:: Opportunity_infiltration_of_the_soul___prelude_2_flavor [nobr]
You will not receive the same letter until at least next year.


:: Opportunity_infiltration_of_the_soul___prelude_3 [nobr]
Tear this stupid letter to shreds


:: Opportunity_infiltration_of_the_soul___prelude_3_flavor [nobr]
Enough is enough! You will not be scammed any longer!
