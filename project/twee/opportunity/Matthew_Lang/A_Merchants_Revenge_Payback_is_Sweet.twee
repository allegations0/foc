    Just be aware that if you leave any survivors it's more likely that the attack will the traced back to you and your company—and you may find the city becomes an increasingly hostile place.

    You spend a few hours getting to know <<name $g.merchant>> a bit better over several rounds of drinks, and you smile when <<their $g.merchant>> foot pushes against yours underneath the table. Eventually, however, you pull yourself away and head back into the city.
<<else>>
    <<if $unit.player.getSpeech() == setup.speech.friendly>>
        You chat amiably with <<name $g.merchant>> while you finish your drink. Afterwards, you head out into the city. <<They $g.merchant>> remain behind, probably ready for the next meeting—whoever that's with.
    <<elseif $unit.player.getSpeech() == setup.speech.bold>>
        You spend some time pushing for more information from <<name $g.merchant>>, but their cagey answers leave you with more questions than before. Downing your drink in frustration, you stomp out of <<lore location_princeofcups>>. You have better things to do with your time today, and now you're going to go and figure out what they were.
    <<elseif $unit.player.getSpeech() == setup.speech.cool>>
        You sip your _pdrink in near silence, enjoying the peace and calm of <<lore location_princeofcups>>. When you're done, you bid <<name $g.merchant>> farewell and head off into the city.
    <<elseif $unit.player.getSpeech() == setup.speech.witty>>
        You regale <<name $g.merchant>> with some of the funnier tales from your life and time passes more quickly than either of you seem to want. Eventually though, you finish your _pdrink and head off into the city as the sun starts to dip lower on the horizon.
    <<elseif $unit.player.getSpeech() == setup.speech.debauched>>
        You flirt outrageously with the <<urace $g.merchant>> as you finish your drink, but they seem generally uninterested in you. Eventually, you head out into the city. Hopefully you'll find a more receptive audience elsewhere.

    Walking into the toilets you head around the corner, past the attendant and straight for the special attractions.
    <<if $unit.player.isHasDick()>>

        Pulling your soft cock out of your <<uequipslot $unit.player 'legs'>>, you head over to the <<woman $g.slaves>> on the right and shove your prick through the circular gag and into <<theirs $g.slaves>> mouth.

        <p>
            Grabbing <<their $g.slaves>> head for leverage you pull them into your crotch and let go, forcing them to swallow rapidly. This time though, your bladder is full from several rounds of drinking, and the volume proves to be too much for <<them $g.slaves>>, causing <<them $g.slaves>> to choke around your cock as the piss splashes out, splattering the front of your <<uequipslot $unit.player 'legs'>>. <br>
            "That's going to stink," you tell them sternly. "If you weren't gagged I'd have you clean me up."<br>

            "No, I'll just get a real piss pig I own to do it later. <<they $g.slaves>> love licking dried piss and spunk of my body before getting fresh loads of both.

        <p>
             The slave whines pathetically as you finish up and tuck your cock away, begging you to fuck <<their $g.slaves>> mouth, almost seeming fearful of the consequences should you leave unsatisfied. Maybe you should see about offering to replace of the slave. <<They $g.slaves>>'s attractive enough, but clearly need more training.
        </p>

    <<else>>
        <p>
            Removing your <<uequipslot $unit.player 'legs'>> and undergarments you position yourself over the <<woman $g.slaves>> on the right and let it flow. <<They $g.slaves>> gulp furiously as your piss splatters over their face, the metal gag preventing them from getting their lips around your pussy. It also prevents <<their $g.slaves>> tongue from reaching you, which is disappointing, but still, that was fun.

    As you walk into the toilet area you wonder how much the all the marble cost and if there's any way you can possibly afford to have your baths done up with elegant stone. Although whether that should be white marble or black marble is something you

        never really thought about one way or another. Not affordable, so why bother?

        Finishing your business, you wash your hands and head off into the city, a map showing the location of the bandit camp tucked away into a pocket.
