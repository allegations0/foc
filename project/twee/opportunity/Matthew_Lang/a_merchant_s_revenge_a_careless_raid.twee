<p>
    It was only later that you found the paperwork. Your contact, <<name $g.merchant>>, never said which trading company—or trading companies—<<they $g.merchant>> ran, but you'd seen the name on the documents you'd already handed over. Clearly, someone had set you up. This left you with a choice:
</p>

<p>
    Do you contact <<them $g.merchant>> to report the incident, or keep things quiet and hope <<they $g.merchant>> doesn't find out?
</p>



:: Opportunity_a_merchant_s_revenge_a_careless_raid_0 [nobr]
Report the incident


:: Opportunity_a_merchant_s_revenge_a_careless_raid_0_flavor [nobr]
<p>
    You leave a message for <<name $g.merchant>> with the staff at <<lore location_princeofcups>>. Hopefully <<they $g.merchant>> get back to you soon.
</p>


:: Opportunity_a_merchant_s_revenge_a_careless_raid_1 [nobr]
Keep things quiet

<p>
    Caravans go missing all the time. You just have to hope the raid on this particular one isn't linked back to you and <<rep $company.player>>.
