:: Opportunity_visiting_the_injured [nobr]
<p>It's been a surprisingly slow week at <<rep $company.player>> and you find
yourself wandering the Fortress. It's come a long way from the ruin you first
came across. In your mind's eye you can still see the scorch marks on the
cracked pavers where you built your first fire, and the nook over there were you
set your bedroll and.... </p>

<p>Well. Memories.</p>

<p>
<<if $g.you.getLover() == $g.covalescent>>
Passing your hospital reminds you that your lover <<name $g.covalescent>> is currently recovering there,
and you caught
<<else>>
Passing the hospital you glance in and see <<name $g.covalescent>>,
<</if>>
a grimace of pain on <<their $g.covalescent>> face as <<they $g.covalescent>> stare moodily out the window. Being injured is a bitch. Well, you have some time.
</p>

<p>Entering the hospital, you head over to <<reps $g.covalescent>> bed and pull the privacy drapes out to, well, give you both a bit of privacy.<br><br>
<<if $g.covalescent.isHasTrait('per_submissive')>>
<<rep $g.covalescent>> looks up as you approach. "Hello Boss."
<<else>>
<<rep $g.covalescent>> looks up as you approach. "Hi <<name $g.you>>."
<</if>>
</p>
<p>What do you decide to do?</p>


:: Opportunity_visiting_the_injured_0 [nobr]
Spend some time with <<them $g.covalescent>>


:: Opportunity_visiting_the_injured_0_flavor [nobr]
<p>"I just came to talk," you say with a grin. "Take your mind off everything."<br><br>
"Great," <<rep $g.covalescent>> says. "I could use a distraction.</p>

<p>
<<if $unit.player.getSpeech() == setup.speech.friendly>>
You spend some time in idle banter, and get to know each other better as a result.
<<elseif $unit.player.getSpeech() == setup.speech.bold>>
You spend a few hours regaling <<rep $g.covalescent>> with tales of <<uhomeland $g.you>>.
<<elseif $unit.player.getSpeech() == setup.speech.cool>>
Since you have a captive audience, so to speak, you spend some time boasting of your recent exploits.
<<elseif $unit.player.getSpeech() == setup.speech.witty>>
You catch <<rep $g.covalescent>> up with the latest gossip and happenings since they've been sick, picking the most outrageous tales you can think of and exaggerating them for comic effect. Before long your stomachs remind you that you both need food and when you glance out the window the sun has begun to set.
<<elseif $unit.player.getSpeech() == setup.speech.debauched>>
You spend some time telling <<rep $g.covalescent>> some of your more ribald exploits. It's not exactly that you mean to, but it is probably your favourite topic. <<if $g.covalescent.isHasTrait('per_chaste')>>
Before long it becomes clear that <<rep $g.covalescent>> isn't really comfortable talking about sex so openly, and you make your excuses and leave.
<<elseif $g.covalescent.isHasTrait('per_sexaddict')>>
<<rep $g.covalescent>> eggs you on, and it soon goes from storytelling to explicit masturbation instructions that make a mess of their bedding.<br><br>
"That was exactly what I needed," <<rep $g.covalescent>> says with a contented smile. "We should do that more often."<br><br>
"Maybe when you're back on your feet," you say, rising to your own, <<if $g.you.isHasDick()>>
trying to ignore the stiffness in your pants and the smell of cum filling the area.
<<else>>
trying to ignore the ache in your pussy and the smell of cum filling the area.
<</if>>
<br><br>
"I'll hold you to that."<br><br>
<<if $g.you.isHasTrait('per_cruel')>>
Smiling, you leave the room. Best to keep them hungry for more.
<<else>>
You lean down and give <<rep $g.covalescent>> a long, lingering kiss.<br><br> "I look forward to it.
<</if>>
<<elseif $g.covalescent.isHasTrait('per_lustful')>>
<<rep $g.covalescent>> enjoys your stories and shares some of their own with you. When you finally leave, you find yourself thinking about finding a partner to relieve your pent up arousal. That said. This is <<rep $company.player>>. You've got options.
<<else>>
<<rep $g.covalescent>> asks you a fair few questions about escapades. If nothing else, they're used to how you speak by now.
<</if>>
<</if>>

:: Opportunity_visiting_the_injured_1 [nobr]
Bring <<them $g.covalescent>> food


:: Opportunity_visiting_the_injured_1_flavor [nobr]
<p>"Hi <<rep $g.covalescent>>. I thought you could use some food."<br><br>
<<if $g.you.isHasTrait('per_empath')>>
<<rep $g.covalescent>> looks at the bowl in your hands. "That's my favourite! How did you know?"<br><br>
You shrug. "You're my crew. It's my job to know."<br><br>
<<rep $g.covalescent>> smiles broadly and reaches for the bowl. "Thank you so much. You are the best boss ever."<br><br>
"I try to be," you say with a smile as you take a seat next to their bed.<br><br>
<p>You spend an hour or so just talking in general before you take your leave, bringing the bowl and spoon with you.</p>
<<elseif $g.you.isHasTrait('per_kind')>>
<<rep $g.covalescent>> looks at the bowl in your hands. "That's my favourite! How did you know?"<br><br>
You shrug. "You're my crew. It's my job to know."<br><br>
<<rep $g.covalescent>> smiles broadly and reaches for the bowl. "Thank you so much. You are the best boss ever."<br><br>
"I try to be," you say with a smile as you take a seat next to their bed.
<p>You spend an hour or so just talking in general before you take your leave, bringing the bowl and spoon with you.</p>
<<elseif $g.you.isHasTrait('per_cruel')>>
<<rep $g.covalescent>> looks at the bowl and their face pales as you try to suppress a grin. It's nourishing, absolutely, but it's heavily laced with the red chillis from across the seas. An acquired taste and one that you love, but <<rep $g.covalescent>> is known for not being great with the spice. "Burns twice" as the joke goes.<br><br>
<<if $g.covalescent.isHasTrait('per_submissive')>>
<<rep $g.covalescent>> meets your gaze for a moment and then drops their eyes.<br><br>
"Yes boss," <<they $g.covalescent>> say, opening their mouth.<br><br>
With two injured arms, they accept you spooning the curry into them and swallow without complaint, even as sweat starts to dot their brow. You almost consider letting them have some milk, or yoghurt to help with the heat but then, maybe this will incentivise them to not get injured in the future.
<<elseif $g.covalescent.isHasTrait('per_masochistic')>>
<<rep $g.covalescent>> meets your gaze for a moment and then drops their eyes, and for a moment you see the ghost of a smile on their face.<br><br>
"Yes <<mistress $g.you>>," <<they $g.covalescent>> say, opening their mouth.<br><br>
With two injured arms, they accept you spooning the curry into them and swallow without complaint, even as sweat starts to dot their brow. You almost consider letting them have some milk, or yoghurt to help with the heat but then, why take away that delicious pain you know they crave?
<<elseif $g.covalescent.isHasTrait('per_dominant')>>
<<name $g.covalescent>> shakes their head firmly.<br><br>
"I'm not eating that. You know I'm not good with chilli at the best of times, and I'm not going to suffer through that while I'm hurt."<br><br>
<<if $g.you.isHasTrait('per_submissive')>>
"Fine," you say turning around to leave. "I'll have someone send something else up to you."<br><br>
Honestly, sometimes you wonder why you even try.
<<elseif $g.you.isHasTrait('per_dominant')>>
You smile your best smile at them. You're proud of your smile. It's the one that makes all the slaves cower when it's turned on them. "That's fair," you say. "And it's not like I can force you."<br><br>
You see the realisation in <<Reps $g.covalescent>> eyes as it hits <<them $g.covalescent>>, and the way they try not to glance down at their injured arms—both injured arms—is really adorable.<br><br>
"Oh wait," you say. "I can."<br><br>
Placing the bowl of curry on the bedside table you reach out and grab their nose. "Open," you say firmly.
<p>Eventually the need to breathe forces them to comply, and you spoon in a mouthful of the extra spicy curry, and then use your spare hand to force their jaw closed.<br><br>
"Swallow."<br><br>
It's a fight to the last mouthful, but they've eventually eaten the entire bowl.<br><br>
"Good <<girl $g.covalescent>>," you say, patting their head gently. "Now next time you're in the field, remember this and do try harder to avoid careless injuries, hmm?"<br><br>
You hear <<rep $g.covalescent>> cursing under <<their $g.covalescent>> breath as you leave, bowl in hand.<br><br>
"What was that?" you call back over your shoulder.<br><br>
"...yes, Boss."</p>
<<else>>
You shrug and place the bowl down on the bedside table.<br><br>
"That's up to you, but this is your food. You won't be getting anything else today. Maybe think about that next time you're out in the field and try a bit harder to avoid careless injuries."
<p>Turning on your heel, you leave the room. Plenty of other things to get on with today, even if you don't know exactly what they are yet.</p>
<</if>>

<<elseif $g.covalescent.isHasTrait('per_stubborn')>>
<<name $g.covalescent>> shakes their head firmly.<br><br>

<</if>>
<<else>>
"Really?" <<rep $g.covalescent>> looks up at you in resignation. "You're punishing me for getting hurt?"<br><br>
"For getting unnecessarily hurt, yes," you say firmly. "Next time you might not come back—or someone else might not come back. Anyway, it's what we're having tonight and you're not getting special treatment just because you fucked up.
<p>You place the bowl down on the table and head out of the hospital. Hopefully they'll do better out there next time."</p>
<</if>>
<<else>>
"Thanks, smells good. What is it?"<br><br>
"Rabbit, bacon and potato stew," you say as you hand the bowl to them. "Nothing fancy, but it'll fill you up."<br><br>
You spend some time talking with them once they've finished their food, but they tire quickly, and you leave them to sleep as you head back out into the fort once more.

Tend <<their $g.covalescent>> wounds


:: Opportunity_visiting_the_injured_2_flavor [nobr]
<p>There comes a point where time is the only thing that can heal fully, but you have some knowledge of ways to help the body along, or at the very least, ease some of the pain.<br><br>
"Hello <<rep $g.covalescent>>, you say. Just here to check on your injuries."<br><br>
<<if $g.you.getSkill(setup.skill.aid) >= 40>>
You're fairly confident in your ability with medicine and cures, and you decide to attempt a healing poultice in addition to a painkiller. The downside of course, is the smell.<br><br>
"Gods, that's rank," <<rep $g.covalescent>> says as you slather the sticky mixture onto a bandage.<br><br>
"That's the idea," you say lightly. "If it smelled nice then you might decide you want to stay here longer than you need to."<br><br>
<<rep $g.covalescent>> sighs. "Look, as long as it stops the itching I'm good."<br><br>
"It will help," you promise. "But some itching is inevitable. It's art of healing."<br><br>
"So you keep telling me," <<rep $g.covalescent>> says, grimacing as you wrap the bandage over their injury. "Fuck that's cold."<br><br>
"It'll warm," you say firmly. "I thought you were a tough slaver."<br><br>
"Boss with all due respect... fuck you."<br><br>
You chuckle as you tie off the bandage and start cleaning up. Hopefully you got this one right.
<<else>>
You're not confident in your knowledge of herbs to really do much more than make their time in the hospital a bit more pleasant, so you mix up a salve to help numb the pain they're in—and smell pleasant while you're at it. <<rep $g.covalescent>> sighs in relief as you apply it to their body.<br><br>
"Thanks, <<name $unit.player>>, that feels great."<br><br>
"You're welcome," you say. "Just rub it on whenever you feel you need it."<br><br>
<<name $g.covalescent>> nods agreeably. "I will."
<p>You spend a bit of time talking about the company and your goals and dreams, but <<rep $g.covalescent>> tires quickly and is soon nodding off. Smiling, you put away the rest of the herbs and supplies and head back out into the fort.</p>

Give <<them $g.covalescent>> some...relief


:: Opportunity_visiting_the_injured_3_flavor [nobr]

You pause to look at <<them $g.covalescent>>, lying there on the bed, both arms splinted and strapped. They have to rely on someone else for just about everything—eating, bathing, getting to the outhouse, or more often than not, chamber pot. Looking down over their <<utorso $g.covalescent>> and crotch you wonder if anyone's been helping with any other source of tension.<br><br>
"Uh, boss, why are you looking at me like that?"<br><br>
You smile and reach for their <<uequipslot $g.covalescent 'legs'>>. "It's been hard enough for you here. I thought I'd help ease some of your tension."<br><br>

<<if $unit.player.getLover() == $g.covalescent>>
<<rep $g.covalescent>> smiles up at you. "As if I'd turn you down, lover. I've been pent up for days."<br><br>
You chuckle as you remove their <<uequipslot $g.covalescent 'legs'>> and
undergarments, revealing the familiar
<<if $g.covalescent.isHasDick()>>
sight of <<their $g.covalescent>> rapidly
stiffening cock. The smell of male musk hits
<<else>>
smell of <<their $g.covalescent>> rapidly increasing arousal.
The smell hits
<</if>>
your nostrils and you can feel
<<if $unit.player.isHasDick()>>
yourself hardening in response.
<<else>>
yourself getting moist down below.
<</if>>

<p>
<<if !$g.covalescent.isHasDick()>>
Looking up into <<reps $g.covalescent>>'s eyes you lower your head to <<their
$g.covalescent>> pussy and eat <<them $g.covalescent>> with <<their
$g.covalescent>> mouth, running your tongue inside the <<them
$g.covalescent>> and exploring the sensitive area that always sets <<them $g.covalescent>> off.<br><br>
"Fuck, <<name $unit.player>> I'm gonna-"
<<their $g.covalescent>> body shudders in response as they climax in ecstacy.
<<else>>
Looking up into <<reps $g.covalescent>>'s eyes you lower your head to <<their
$g.covalescent>> groin and take <<them $g.covalescent>> into <<their
$g.covalescent>> mouth, running your tongue into the spot beneath <<their
$g.covalescent>> cockhead that always sets <<them $g.covalescent>> off.<br><br>
"Fuck, <<name $unit.player>> I'm gonna-" <<their $g.covalescent>> cock swells in
your mouth and you feel <<them $g.covalescent>> shoot, sweet, salty and bitter
all at once filling your mouth and coating your tongue as you swallow rapidly,
some of it spilling out down the sides of <<their $g.covalescent>> cock despite
your best efforts.
<</if>>
</p>

"That was quick," you say, pulling back with your mouth as you
<<if $g.covalescent.isHasDick()>>
stroke <<their $g.covalescent>> still hard cock.
<<else>>
withdraw your tongue.
<</if>>

<br><br>
"Sorry love," <<they $g.covalescent>> says sheepishly. "Like I said, I've been a bit pent up."
<br><br>

<<if $g.covalescent.isHasDick()>>
<p>

Looking down over <<they $g.covalescent>> <<utorso $g.covalescent>> crotch and butt you have the urge to take <<them $g.covalescent>>. It's not like <<they $g.covalescent>> could stop you.

"Uh, boss, why are you looking at me like that?"<br><br>
You grin as you move forward and raise your hand, revealing the ball gag you were hiding behind your back. "Because you and me are going to have some fun," you say calmly.

Reaching forward you ease <<theirs $g.covalescent>> <<uequipslot $g.covalescent 'legs'>> and underwear down of <<theirs $g.covalescent>> body, helping <<them $g.covalescent>> raise up to get the clothing out from beneath <<theirs $g.covalescent>> hips.

"Hey, babe, my eyes are up here," you say, earning a snort of laughter not quite muffled by the gag.<br><br>
Raising your head you run your hands down the length of your neck, over your <<ubreasts $g.you>>, lingering over your abs before reaching your hips. When you finally look at them their eyes are glued to your crotch, and you slip one hand inside your <<uequipslot $unit.player 'legs'>> to

Stalking to the foot of the bed you climb onto it, pushing <<reps $g.covalescent>> legs up until they're resting on <<their $g.covalescent>> shoulders, and revealing <<their $g.covalescent>> <<uhole $g.covalescent>> to your lustful gaze. You press the head of your cock up against <<their $g.covalescent>> entrance. Not hard enough to enter, but enough to rub, excite and just start to maybe slip in by accident. Reaching forward you rub <<their $g.covalescent>> chest with your left hand, teasing <<their $g.covalescent>> nipples as your right hand gently grasps <<their $g.covalescent>> cock, and starts gently stroking, working the precum dripping from <<their $g.covalescent>> penis over <<their $g.covalescent>> shaft.
<p><<rep $g.covalescent>> is torn between pushing into your hand or back onto your cock, and you're forced to hold <<their $g.covalescent>> hips down. Just to keep <<them $g.covalescent>> from hurting <<themself $g.covalescent>> of course. A frustrated

You punctuate each word with a long, languid stroke of <<reps $g.covalescent>> cock. "And there's....nothing...you can do about it. Isn't that going to be fun?"<br><br>
<<rep $g.covalescent>> looks at you with pleading eyes, words obviously failing <<them $g.covalescent>> right now.<br><br>

"Well that's just rude," you say as you rub your hand through the mess on <<their $g.covalescent>> torso. "You know what this means, right?"<br><br>
<<rep $g.covalescent>> pauses, unsure of which answer is better right at this moment. Finally, <<they $g.covalescent>> shakes <<their $g.covalescent>> head 'no', <<their $g.covalescent>> face flushed and chest still heaving from orgasm.<br><br>
"It means, I'm going to have to fuck you anyway until I cum... and you won't have the benefit of being really horny when I do..."</p>
<p><<rep $g.covalescent>>moans as you slick your cock up with <<their $g.covalescent>> cum and then work the rest of <<their $g.covalescent>> load into <<their $g.covalescent>> ass with your fingers.

When you're both finally spent, <<rep $g.covalescent>> is a cumsoaked mess and you're little better, barely managing to fall to one side, rather than on top of <<them $g.covalescent>>. Reaching up you gently remove the gag and give <<them $g.covalescent>> a deep kiss.<br><br>
"I love you," you whisper as you drop the ball gag off the side of the bed.<br><br>
<<They $g.covalescent>> licks <<their $g.covalescent>> lips and swallows a few times, getting <<their $g.covalescent>> mouth back in working order before replying. "I love you too, <<name $unit.player>>."<br><br>
You are tempted to just lie there with <<them $g.covalescent>>, hoping that you can find a snuggle position that doesn't put pressure on <<their $g.covalescent>> arms, but instead, you sigh and push yourself up onto your elbows.<br><br>
"I should probably find something to clean up with. This place reeks of sex now."<br><br>
