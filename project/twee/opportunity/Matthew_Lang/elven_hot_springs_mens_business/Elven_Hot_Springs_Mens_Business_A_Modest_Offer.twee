As you are sorting out paperwork on your desk you find a note, dropped off by one of slavers from the mail room.
<div class='lettercard'>
    <p>
        Dear <<name $unit.player>>,
    </p>
    <p>
        I very much enjoyed meeting you at the Hot Springs recently, and hope you'll return next year. I was very taken by the slave you brought and I want to buy him. I'm willing to pay <<money _v>> if you can arrange delivery to my estate in the forests.
    </p>
    <p>
        Warmest Regards,
    </p>
    <p>
        Lord <<name $g.buyer>> _surname
    </p>
</div>
(The price will be slightly lower if your player character's level is low.)

Sell the slave

<p>
    You package up the
    <<if $g.slave.isHasTrait('training_none')>>
        disobedient
    <<else>>
        meek
    <</if>>
    slave and have <<them $g.slave>> delivered to the Lord's estate, your slavers returning with the promised sum of money. All in all, a good sale.
</p>

Decline the offer


:: Opportunity_elven_hot_springs_men_s_business_a_modest_offer_1_flavor [nobr]
<p>
    You decide that you're interested in selling <<rep $g.slave>> at that price and send a polite note declining the offer. Still, it's nice to know you made an impression.
