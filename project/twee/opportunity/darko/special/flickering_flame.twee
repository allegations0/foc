<p>
In the recent days, you and <<yourrep $g.lover>> lover|have become rather
close. You have always considered <<therace $g.lover>> slaver as your friend,
but you never realized how much the <<uadjgood $g.lover>> slaver has lusted
over you in the last few weeks.
</p>

<p>
It culminated today when you find <<rep $g.lover>> waiting for you inside your office.

<<if $g.lover.getSpeech() == setup.speech.friendly || $g.lover.getSpeech() == setup.speech.witty>>

<<They $g.lover>> gently lover|grab your <<uhands $unit.player>>, while
whispering to your <<uears $unit.player>> <<their $g.lover>> undying devotion
to you, before asking you to become <<their $g.lover>> lover.

<<elseif $g.lover.getSpeech() == setup.speech.bold || $g.lover.getSpeech() == setup.speech.cool>>

<<They $g.lover>> wordlessly lover|grab your <<uhands $unit.player>>, stoically
pronouncing <<their $g.lover>> devotion to you, and asking you to become
<<their $g.lover>> lover.

<<elseif $g.lover.getSpeech() == setup.speech.debauched>>

<<They $g.lover>> suddenly lover|grab you by your <<uwaist $unit.player>>,
putting you in an awkward position, with <<their $g.lover>> lips almost
touching yours. <<They $g.lover>> then lover|profess their lust for your <<ubody
$unit.player>>, before asking you to become <<their $g.lover>> lover.
<</if>>

</p>

<p>
How will you respond?

<p>
Upon hearing the words coming out from your mouth, <<yourrep $g.lover>>

<<if $g.lover.getSpeech() == setup.speech.friendly>>
joyfully lover|close the distance between you and gently lover|kiss your <<umouth $unit.player>>.
For a long moment both of you are locked tight in an embrace, time slowing down all
around you.

<<elseif $g.lover.getSpeech() == setup.speech.bold>>
can't help but smirked a little, before
<<if $g.lover.isFemale()>>
leaping into your embrace.
<<else>>
pulling you deep for a possessive embrace.
<</if>>
The embrace lasts for a good warm moment, both in your heart and in your <<ugenital $unit.player>>.

<<elseif $g.lover.getSpeech() == setup.speech.cool>>
stoically lover|close the distance between you and, without saying a word, lover|kiss
your <<umouth $unit.player>>. This is perhaps the most animated your cool slaver has ever been
in <<their $g.lover>> life.

<<elseif $g.lover.getSpeech() == setup.speech.witty>>
visibly lover|raise a surprised eyebrow, before regaining <<their $g.lover>>
composure and lover|give your acceptance a witty reply. But before you are allowed
to respond, you find <<them $g.lover>> already very close to you before stealing your
lips for a kiss.

<<elseif $g.lover.getSpeech() == setup.speech.debauched>>
lover|laugh maniacally before leaping towards you and giving you the deepest kiss
you have ever experienced in your life. It will be quite an adventure having
made the debauched slaver into your lover, one you are very much looking
forward to.

<</if>>
</p>

<p>
You have never wanted the night to come as quickly as it was in that moment!

<p>
Unfortunately, you have no interest in the <<man $g.lover>>. <<Rep $g.lover>>
lover|look absolutely devastated by the refusal, and lover|leave your office without
saying a word. <<They $g.lover>> will surely be traumatized by this, but
nothing time cannot heal.
