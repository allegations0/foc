:: Opportunity_at_what_cost [nobr]

<p>
Due to recent events, you have found yourself in an unfortunate predicament.
You are currently en-route to board a ship, no doubt to be sold as a valuable
slave in some distant land across the sea. If you want to escape, you have to
act fast, and now!
</p>

<p>
Being a senior slaver yourself, you know that such an escape will be almost
impossible, if you are not bold.
<<if $g.you.isHasTrait('per_submissive')>>
(Not to mention that little submissive part of you that keep telling you to resign to your fate.)
<<elseif $g.you.isHasTrait('per_dominant')>>
But boldness has always been a part of your dominant mind.
<<else>>
You have to muster all the strength you can gather.
<</if>>
But more importantly, you will certainly need to make a choice, to sacrifice
a part of you in order to make the escape possible.
</p>

<p>
You can sacrifice your sanity, which will surely has a permanent impact on your psyche...
</p>

<p>
You can sacrifice your memory, which will likely make you forgot certain skills you have in the past...
</p>

<p>
Or you can sacrifice your body and mind, which will cripple you for a year or
two, but with no other permanent effect...
</p>

<p>
Either way, you have to make a decision now and fast!
</p>


:: Opportunity_at_what_cost_0 [nobr]
At the cost of your sanity


:: Opportunity_at_what_cost_0_flavor [nobr]
<p>
You decided to feign to the slavers that you have given up on escaping, and
adopted the mindset of a slave. The ruse eventually pays off, as the slavers
undo your bindings seeing the compliant slave that they think you have
became. You manage to escape during the night, without looking back.
</p>

<p>
Still, you can't help but feel that some part of this slave mindset will
haunt you for the rest of your days...
</p>


:: Opportunity_at_what_cost_1 [nobr]
At the cost of your memory


:: Opportunity_at_what_cost_1_flavor [nobr]
<p>
You decided to feign to the slavers that your mind has been broken. You spend
several days drooling like a mindbroken slave, unfocused at everything. The
ruse eventually pays off, as the slavers undo your bindings seeing the
mindbroken slave that they think you have became. You managed to escape
during the night, without looking back.
</p>

<p>
Still, you are deeply affected by the ruse, and you can feel some part of
your memory flew away, like it was never there to begin with...
</p>


:: Opportunity_at_what_cost_2 [nobr]
At the cost of your body and mind


:: Opportunity_at_what_cost_2_flavor [nobr]
<p>
You decide to rebel against the slavers, fighting them and injuring some of
them in the struggle. In retaliation, the slavers exact their revenge on
you, leaving you gasping and severely beaten by the end of the ordeal. Seeing
no more value in the broken slave that you have become, the slavers dump
you in one of the villages along the way.
</p>

<p>
You are able to make it back to your company with your mind mostly intact,
but with heavy injuries and a trauma to haunt you for a year or two...
</p>
