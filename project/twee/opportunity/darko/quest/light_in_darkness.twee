<p>
You have received news that an upcoming slave auction in the undercity of
Lucgate will feature a very special slave: an exotic specimen from the
<<lore region_sea>> gifted in the domain of <<lore magic_light>>.
The price will be astronomical and there is no way that buying the slave would be
anywhere profitable for your company. But
there is an option for you to send your slavers over to
kidnap the goods.
This will surely be dangerous, and who knows what
might happen to your slavers if they were caught...
</p>

<p>
You also need to decide what to do with the goods once and if you manage to smuggle them out.
You can certainly make use of such a highly prized slave, but there is also
an option of convincing them to join as a slaver.
