<p>
The domain of <<lore magic_earth>> grants their wielder control over
growth, including the ability to accelerate the growth of plants and control
over the earth. An exceptionally gifted wielder can use the magic to form tentacle aberrations,
be it from clay or from vines.
</p>

<p>
There are rumors of a particularly powerful wizard living in the <<lore region_forest>>
whose mastery over the earth domain is so vast that they are able to conjure multiple tentacled guardians to
watch over their lair. It is believed that those guardians makes the lair extremely
dangerous and risky to invade,
even though the lair contains the wizard's personal harem and many arcane and
mystical treasures.
</p>

<p>
Your scouts have recently located on the wizard's lairs, which gives you several options to choose from.
The simplest option is to raid the caverns â€” according to the rumors, the wizard stores multiple
powerful artifacts there, all ripe for stealing.
There is also another option: you can
attempt to contact the wizard instead, and recruit them into your company.
Having a slaver with such proficiency of earth magic will surely prove
very useful in a slaving company such as yours.
