<<set _headunit = setup.getUnit({title: "tower_of_roses_admirer", job: setup.job.slaver})>>
<<if !_headunit>>
  <<missingunitquest>>
<<else>>

<p>
<<Yourrep _headunit>> received a letter from an elven <<prince $g.prince>> in
the <<lore region_forest>>, asking <<them _headunit>> to come privately on a full
moon night to <<their $g.prince>> tower. It seems that <<reps _headunit>>
efforts have borne fruit, and the <<prince $g.prince>> is now deeply infatuated
with your slaver. Now you have to decide what to do.
</p>

<p>
The first option is to actually go actually and fulfill the <<prince
$g.prince>>'s dream and send the <<prince $g.prince>> <<their $g.prince>> 
<<if _headunit.isHasDick()>>knight in shining armor<<else>>knight in sexy armor<</if>>.
Of course, your slaver isn't going to leave your company and instead <<rep
_headunit>> will try to recruit <<them $g.prince>> into the company, which will
be the difficult part. Still, <<rep _headunit>> looks enthusiastic with this
option â€” it seems the love goes both ways.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, you could use <<rep _headunit>> to enslave the poor <<prince $g.prince>>. 
Of course, <<rep _headunit>> will probably be devastated by this
turn of events should you go through with it, but it's surely a small price
for such a valuable slave?
