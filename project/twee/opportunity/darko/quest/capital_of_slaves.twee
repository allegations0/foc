<p>
The largest city in the desert, the <<lore location_qarma>>, houses the
largest slave market in the region. All kinds of slaves are available
in the market — from nearby ex-raiders who were captured and turned into slaves, to exotic
travelers unlucky enough to found their way into the market.
</p>

<p>
You have an opportunity to send a group of slavers to visit the market, and
there are several options you can take here.
The safest option is to simply browse
through the wares, while noting particularly interesting slaves for you to purchase.
Another option is to sell your own stock to the market — the market is highly
competitive, however, and you would not get too hot of a price there. But it
would be very easy to get plenty of the orders.
The last option is to attempt to sneak in during the night and steal some of the merchandise
— this will net you quite a bit of slaves, but it will be very dangerous for your
slavers should they fail.
