<<set _u = setup.getAnySlaver()>>

<p>
You have just received the news that a ferocious pirating company is planning
an assault on a small lizardkin settlement in the <<lore region_sea>>.
Normally, this would not be yours or your company's problem, but <<yourrep
_u>> suggests that this might be a rare opportunity for to gain the trust of
these scaled people. You could try to send a group of able fighters
to help out fend the pirates away.
</p>

<p>
However, you have a brighter idea. The battle between the pirates and the
lizardkin will surely be intense, so that means you can send a group of
slavers "pretending" to help out, and kidnap a downed lizardkin or two in the
heat of battle. No doubt this will be incredibly dangerous, as well as
earning you a lot of ire from these folks. But such is the price you have
to pay for a lizardkin slave...
