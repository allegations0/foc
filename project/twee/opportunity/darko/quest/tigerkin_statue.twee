<p>
Having acquired an extremely rare tigerkin statue from your slavers'
misadventure, it is time to decide what to do with them.
</p>

<p>
The first option is to simply keep the statue as prestigious decorations.
After being imprisoned for so long, there is no doubt that the minds of these
tigerkins are long gone, and it might best to leave them as statues which
will surely worth more than the actual tigerkins. Plus,
<<if $g.gender.isHasDick()>>
there is surely fun to be had with a statue blessed with a permanently erect and leaking dick...
<<else>>
there is surely fun to be had with a statue blessed with a permanently wet and leaking pussy...
<</if>>
</p>

<p>
Alternatively you could try to undo the petrification in the same way with
all other statues â€” via anal overload. Given the age of the statue, it will
require a special kind of anal overload ritual however, and the resulting
slave will also no doubt came out mindbroken. Is it really worth all these
efforts?
