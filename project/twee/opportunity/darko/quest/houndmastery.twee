:: Opportunity_houndmastery [nobr]
<p>
Having fulfilled the strange slave order, the hound<<master $g.master>>,
satisfied with the slave, offers you a wealth of rewards for your choosing.
</p>

<<if !$inventory.isHasItem(setup.item.technology_petmaster)>>
<p>
First, <<they $g.master>> offers to teach you the secret to training pets.
A remarkably valuable reward!
</p>
<</if>>

<p>
If you are willing to shell a little more coin out of your pocket, the
hound<<master $g.master>> is willing to part with one of <<their $g.master>>
rarest creation: the <<rep setup.equipment.tailplug_dog_master>>. This is
likely the only place in <<lore geo_mestia>> where you can get this very rare
equipment!
</p>

<<if $inventory.isHasItem(setup.item.technology_petmaster)>>
<p>
<<if $settings.bannedtags.furry>>
  <<dangertext 'Warning:'>> This option contains <<dangertext 'furry'>> content, which you have banned!
<</if>>
Finally, you've been eyeing one of the more... exotic pets of the
hound<<master $g.master>>. An extremely rare tigerkin slave,
which makes you wonder how the <<man $g.master>> caught
one in the first place. Nonetheless, you are sure that <<they $g.master>>
will be willing to lend you the slave, as long as you promise to return the
pet at a later date (which you should not break or face dire consequences...)
</p>
<</if>>


:: Opportunity_houndmastery_0 [nobr]
Get the <<rep setup.item.technology_petmaster>>


:: Opportunity_houndmastery_1 [nobr]
Pay to get the <<rep setup.equipment.tailplug_dog_master>>


:: Opportunity_houndmastery_2 [nobr]
Borrow the tigerskin slave for seven months


:: Opportunity_houndmastery_2_flavor [nobr]
<p>
In your infinite wisdom, you have decided to borrow the slave <<rep
$g.sniffer>> instead. Well <<they $g.sniffer>> sniffer|is certainly an incredibly rare
slave, and you can definitely have some fun with the tigerkin for a while, but
<<they $g.sniffer>> will have to be returned eventually. If the slave is ever
gone from your company, or if the slave was to be returned transformed, no doubt
the consequences will be dire, and the hound<<master $g.master>> will easily
sever all connections with your company forever.
</p>

<p>
The hound<<master $g.master>> brags about the slave's particularly sensitive
nose â€” perhaps it could be put to good use somewhere in the <<lore
region_forest>>, if one knows where to look...
</p>
