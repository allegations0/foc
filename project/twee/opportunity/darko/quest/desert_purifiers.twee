<p>
The denizens of the eastern desert are often gifted with the aspect of fire.
While basic fire mastery lends itself to destruction,
individuals blessed with advanced fire magic sometimes are able summon purifying
fire instead, which can cleanse corruptions and demons alike.
These people are often sought after for their services, and is
widely considered capable of blessing whoever happened to bathed in their flames.

<p>
You have caught wind of a small group of purifiers that are journeying through the
<<lore region_desert>>. This is a rare opportunity for you â€” you can try to either purify some of
your slavers using their services, or you can
try to recruit some of these purifiers into your slaving company.
Alternatively, if you are feeling particularly brave you
can attempt to try and enslave the lead purifier.
Such attempt would require you to send a slaver gifted in the dark arts, and
even then it is surely going to be a dangerous affair.
