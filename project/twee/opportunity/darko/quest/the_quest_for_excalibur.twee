<p>
The Excalibur sword lies on your desk, while <<yourrep $g.knight>> knight|is
currently staying fully bound in one of the nicer dungeon cells. You need to make a
decision how to save <<therace $g.knight>> from the influence of
the sword.
</p>

<<set _u = setup.getDutySlaver('viceleader', 'rescuer')>>

<p>
You can try to return the sword back to the vaults â€” with the sword far, far away
from its wielder, hopefully <<yourrep $g.knight>> will return back to <<their
$g.knight>> <<uadjgood $g.knight>> self. Alternatively, <<yourrep _u>>
suggested a very different idea: corrupt the sword entirely until it becomes
nothing but an instrument for
evil. Surely it will then align with your company's adventures, and will no
longer cause problems with <<rep $g.knight>>, although corrupting such a
powerful artifact will surely be <<dangertext 'extremely'>> dangerous...
