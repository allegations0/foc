<<dangertext "Due to your company missing a slave important for this opportunity, this opportunity is no longer able to be completed.">>
<<else>>

<p>
Having completed all the necessary steps to fulfill <<their _headunit>>
destiny, your company has gained clear understanding of what kind of destiny
awaited <<rep _headunit>> â€” the trials represented the seven great sins:
Sloth - represented by <<their _headunit>> human-like arms,
Gluttony - represented by <<their _headunit>> werewolf tail,
Lust - represented by <<their _headunit>> addled neko eyes,
Greed - represented by <<their _headunit>> twitching elven ears,
Wrath - represented by <<their _headunit>> orcish tusks,
Envy - represented by <<their _headunit>> painful hooves,
and Pride - represented by <<their _headunit>> lizard-like scales.
This can only means that the destiny
that awaits <<rep _headunit>> is to be an exalted plaything of one of the
demon lords of <<lore concept_mist>>, who loves nothing more than the most
debauched and the rarest of specimens.
</p>

<p>
With a slaver gifted in corruption, it would be possible to deliver the fully
corrupted slave yourself to the demon lord. The ritual must take place on a
specific island within the <<lore region_sea>>, and furthemore it will be both lengthy
and incredibly dangerous. But if done properly, the demon lord might be
willing to bestow some of the otherwordly technology upon your unworthy
company.
</p>

<p>
Choosing to complete the ritual will surely condemn <<yourrep _headunit>> to an
eternity of being the demon lord's plaything. Having to spend all <<their
_headunit>> time in service to the demon lord's debauched fantasies, it would
be impossible for you to meet the slave again. But the reward is <<umouth $unit.player>>-watering.
</p>

<p>
However, there is hope if you instead foolishly wish to save the slave. If
you somehow have grown too attached to a mere slave such as <<rep _headunit>>,
you can try to contact some
of the strongest purifiers living off the <<lore region_sea>> for the slight chance
that they will be able to lift the curse from <<rep _headunit>> forever,
freeing <<them _headunit>> from the terrible fate that awaits them. There is
no doubt that such purification ritual will also have a profound effect on
the slave's body, possibly reverting some of the bodily transformation that
has been inflicted upon <<them _headunit>>. If you choose this option and
still wish to obtain the demon's technology, then you must find another fated
adventurer and begin anew at a later date..., so why would anyone choose this option?
