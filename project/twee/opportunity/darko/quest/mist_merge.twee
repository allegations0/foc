<p>
Many residents from beyond <<lore concept_mist>> have attempted to cross to this
world, but only very few succeed.
A direct trip is extremely dangerous for the demons,
and the preferrred method seems to be of that of possession: With a proper sacrifice
and high level <<lore magic_dark>>, one could invite one of <<lore
concept_mist>> residents to come to this world by entering a sacrifice's
body and overriding their mind.
The sacrifice's real self will be locked securely deep within their body
while the demon will be granted full control over the body, potentially forever.
</p>

<p>
An eastern settlement has come asking for your company's help to thwart an
upcoming dark ritual held too close to their village.
But <<yourrep _u>> informs you that this is no ordinary dark ritual â€” this
is actually a powerful dark wizard's attempt to try and wrest control a demon over to their
side, using the sacrificial possession ritual.
</p>

<p>
There are a number of options for you here.
First, if you are feeling particularly good-hearted,
you could try do as the village ask and send your best purifiers to
thwart and disrupt the ritual. This will surely earn the gratitude of the
settlement.
On the other hand, demons make for incredibly powerful allies.
You could try to send your slavers to help the wizard in exchange
for recruiting one of the possessive demons as a slaver.
Just be warned that should the ritual fails, the consequences will be disastrous.
