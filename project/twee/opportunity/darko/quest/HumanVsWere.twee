<<set _u = setup.getAnySlaver()>>

<p>
<<Yourrep _u>> informed you that
the werewolves of the <<lore region_vale>> are planning
to launch an assault on one of the settlements there.
This presents an opportunity for you.
First, you can inform the villagers and stand together with them in defense
--- the villager will surely be grateful and may offer you a reward.
Alternatively, you can wait until the attack begins and kidnap some of the villagers during the chaos.
