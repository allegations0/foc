:: Opportunity_consumed_by_darkness [nobr]

<p>
Unexpected, instead of a simple demand of payment like all your previous
letters, this time the demon that is currently tutoring <<yourrep $g.slaver>> is actually
offering you an offer.
</p>

<p>
The demon is offering to buy <<therace $g.slaver>> from you â€” no doubt to be remade as
one of <<their $g.master>> personal sex toys. It seems <<they $g.master>> master|have
taken quite a liking to <<theslaver $g.slaver>>. The promised reward is mouth-watering:
the demon promises to champion your company's reputation among other demons,
propelling your company's reputation so much that it'll be on the tip of
every demon's conversations. If that's not reward enough, the demon even
promises to throw in one of <<their $g.master>> demonkin sex toys over to you
as well.
</p>

<p>
However, you have known <<rep $g.slaver>> for quite some time now, and
<<theslaver $g.slaver>> slaver|have served you
<<if $g.slaver.isHasTrait('per_loyal')>>
very loyally
<<elseif $g.slaver.isHasTrait('per_independent')>>
well, although you question <<their $g.slaver>> loyalty from time to time
<<else>>
loyally
<</if>>
thus far. Do you really have the heart to exchange one of your slavermates
in exchange for a demon's bargain?
</p>


:: Opportunity_consumed_by_darkness_0 [nobr]
No, just complete the training by offering your body as payment


:: Opportunity_consumed_by_darkness_0_flavor [nobr]

<p>
You reject the offer. <<Reps $g.slaver>> loyalty and long term of service
to you will not go punished with a betrayal.
</p>


:: Opportunity_consumed_by_darkness_1 [nobr]
Accept the offer


:: Opportunity_consumed_by_darkness_1_flavor [nobr]
<p>
Despite <<reps $g.slaver>> long service in your company, the demon's offer
is just too tempting, and you have fallen for it.
The moment you sign the parchment, it burns itself to cinders, sealing
the deal. You will never again see <<yourrep $g.slaver>>, whose destiny is now to
be one of the no-doubt many playthings of the demon. All in exchange for a
lot of goodwill from the demonkins, as well as a shipment of slave to be
delivered to your address very soon.
</p>

<p>
You've tried all you can to prevent the news from reaching your other slavers, but
somehow they know, and they are distressed by the turn of events...
</p>
