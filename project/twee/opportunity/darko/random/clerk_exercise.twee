<p>
Not everyone under your employ comes from a physical background. Take <<yourrep $g.slaver>>, for example. Before joining your company, <<therace $g.slaver>> slaver|was mostly working behind the desk. Given <<their $g.slaver>> previous occupation, it's not really surprising that <<their $g.slaver>> body isn't as well-developed as some of your other slavers, and tire somewhat easily too.
<<if $unit.player.isHasTrait('bg_clerk')>>
You understand it too, given that you were also working behind the desk some years past.
<</if>>
</p>

<p>
<<Theslaver $g.slaver>> slaver|think so too. <<They $g.slaver>> apparently slaver|have been eyeing the <<rep setup.buildingtemplate.traininggrounds>>, and thinking to train up <<their $g.slaver>> body and make it fitter there. It'll take a few weeks of intensive training, but <<they $g.slaver>> will come out stronger and better than before.
</p>

<p>
<<They $g.slaver>> won't be available for any job at all during the intensive training, however, and hence you should decide whether you'd allow the silly-sounding self-improvement training or not.
</p>

Allow

<p>
Full of enthusiasm, <<yourrep $g.slaver>> makes a beeline for your <<rep setup.buildingtemplate.traininggrounds>>. The training will take quite a toll on <<therace $g.slaver>>, and <<they $g.slaver>> won't be available for any duty for the time being, but you hope that the results would be worth it.
</p>


:: Opportunity_clerk_exercise_1 [nobr]
Disallow


:: Opportunity_clerk_exercise_1_flavor [nobr]
<p>
Your company does not always accept physical jobs. There are also jobs where you're supposed to negotiate or even write reports. <<Yourrep $g.slaver>> would not need to be very fit for those, and you feel <<their $g.slaver>> current stature is already fine. <<Theslaver $g.slaver>> slaver|feel a little down from your refusal, however good its intention.
</p>
