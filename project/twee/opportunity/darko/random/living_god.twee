<p>
With the shrine completed, you could try to ask <<yourrep $g.god>> to direct <<their $g.god>> worship in a particular way...
</p>

<p>
You can ask <<them $g.god>> to base <<their $g.god>> worship towards money â€” asking the followers to donate a generous amount of tithe. <<Rep $g.god>> will take most of it, of course, but as the proprietor of the fort the naturally you would get a small cut of the tithe.
<<if $g.god.isHasTrait('per_honorable')>>
Unfortunately, <<reps $g.god>> honorable nature means <<therace $g.god>> immediately scoffs at the suggestion, and refuses to follow through with this.
<</if>>
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, you can ask <<them $g.god>> to simply hold honest-to-goodness sermons, no strings attached, except maybe the inclusion of some good words about your company.
<<if $g.god.isHasTrait('per_evil')>>
The evil slaver however likes the idea of getting a "generous amount of tithe", and refuses to go through with this option...
<</if>>

:: Opportunity_living_god_0 [nobr]
Generous tithe


:: Opportunity_living_god_0_flavor [nobr]
<p>
You directed <<yourrep $g.god>> to focus <<their $g.god>> worshippers towards "donating" a generous amount of tithe. While <<they $g.god>> will pocket most of them for the "greater good", your company will take a small cut for lending the shrine for the worship.
</p>




:: Opportunity_living_god_1 [nobr]
Sermons


:: Opportunity_living_god_1_flavor [nobr]
<p>
You directed <<yourrep $g.god>> to just hold honest sermons.
</p>

<p>
In the coming days, you notice that <<their $g.god>> many followers would often talk well about your company.
</p>




:: Opportunity_living_god_2 [nobr]
Forget this stupid idea


:: Opportunity_living_god_2_flavor [nobr]
<p>
<<Rep $g.god>> is a slaver, not some deity to worship!
</p>
