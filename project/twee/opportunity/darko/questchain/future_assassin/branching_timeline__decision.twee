:: Opportunity_branching_timeline__decision [nobr]

<p>
You have captured the assailant who once assaulted your lover.
While the threat is finally over, one last question looms in your head.
If what the assailant is claiming is true, then if you continue to love
someone but <<rep $g.parent>>, then <<they $g.child>> will cease to exist.
</p>

<p>
Would you choose love or the life of a stranger?
</p>

<<unitcard $g.child 1>>

:: Opportunity_branching_timeline__decision_0 [nobr]
Become lovers with <<if $g.parent>><<rep $g.parent>><</if>>


:: Opportunity_branching_timeline__decision_0_flavor [nobr]
<<set _u = $unit.player.getLover()>>
<<if _u == $g.parent>>
<p>
Well.. you are already lovers with <<rep $g.parent>> already. There is
nothing to do here, and <<rep $g.child>> can continue to exist regardless of
your choice.
</p>
<<elseif _u>>
<p>
Taking pity on the poor time traveler, you have decided to hook up with <<rep
$g.parent>> instead. You said one last goodbye to your now ex-lover <<rep
_u>>, before tentatively testing the warmth of your new lover's embrace.
</p>
<</if>>

<<run setup.qc.HookupWithYou('parent').apply($gQuest)>>

<p>
Locked in an awkward embrace, you try your best to exhude confidence gazing
at your new lover's <<ueyes $g.parent>>. Sure, this entire lover thing might
be a thing of convenience just to ensure that <<rep $g.child>> continue to
exist, but you have no doubt that given time, you can certainly develop
affection towards <<rep $g.parent>>.
</p>

<p>
You still have to decide what to do with the time-traveler.
</p>


:: Opportunity_branching_timeline__decision_1 [nobr]
Stay with your lover


:: Opportunity_branching_timeline__decision_1_flavor [nobr]
<<set _u = $unit.player.getLover()>>
<<if _u == $g.parent>>
<p>
Well.. you are already lovers with <<rep $g.parent>> already. There is
nothing to do here, and <<rep $g.child>> can continue to exist regardless of
your choice.
</p>
<<elseif !_u>>
<<else>>
<p>
Between the choice of love and a stranger, you ultimately choose love. After
all, what is a stronger force than love? Just thinking about <<yourrep _u>> makes
your heart feels giddy, and the world would not be the same without <<therace
_u>> by your side.
</p>

<p>
Seeing your decision, <<rep $g.child>> child|resign to <<their $g.child>> fate.
Soon enough, <<their $g.child>> body begins to glow white — but not
disappearing! In fact, as you and <<yourrep _u>> continue to be locked in a
tight embrace, your <<daughter $g.child>> visibly child|transform before you.
</p>

<<set _father = $unit.player>>
<<set _mother = _u>>

<<if !_father.isHasDick() && _mother.isHasDick()>>
<<set _mother = $unit.player>>
<<set _father = _u>>
<</if>>

<<set _preference = $settings.getGenderPreference(setup.job.slaver)>>

<<if Math.random() < 0.5>>
<<set _preference = $settings.getGenderPreference(setup.job.slave)>>
<</if>>

<<set _w = setup.UnitBirth.generateChild(_father, _mother, _preference)>>

<p>
<<= setup.Text.Unit.Bodyswap.bodyswap($g.child, _w)>>
</p>

<<run setup.qcImpl.Bodyswap.doBodySwap($g.child, _w)>>
<<run $family.unsetRelation($g.child, $g.parent)>>
<<run $family.setParent(_mother, $g.child)>>
<<run $family.setParent(_father, $g.child)>>

<<run _w.delete()>>

<p>
The transformation ended, <<reps $g.child>> appearance has drastically
changed. <<Therace $g.child>> lost all resemblance to <<rep $g.parent>>, and
instead much child|resembles you and your lover. It seems that the prophecy was
incorrect — <<they $g.child>> would not be disappear, but would instead align
<<themself $g.child>> to fit with the new timeline. <<Rep _u>> tentatively
touched <<their _u>> <<daughter $g.child>>'s face while you decide what to do
now...
</p>
