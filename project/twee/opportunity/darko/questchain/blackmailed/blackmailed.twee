<<set _u = setup.getAnySlaver()>>

<p>
Today, you receive a good news and a bad news.
</p>

<p>
The good news is that you've heard back from <<yourrep $g.slaver>>, who went missing sometime ago.
</p>

<p>
The bad news is that <<therace $g.slaver>> seems to have found <<themself
$g.slaver>> under the tender care of a rival slaving company. Their boss, the
<<urace $g.boss>> named <<rep $g.boss>>, has the nerve the demand payment for <<reps $g.slaver>> "continued safe hospitality" — a sum of <<money 2000>> payable every month.
</p>

<p>
If you want to ensure <<reps $g.slaver>> safety, best to acquiesce to this
reasonable demand. Otherwise you will never see <<rep $g.slaver>> ever again,
as <<they $g.slaver>> will be shipped to a place somewhere far, far away...
</p>



:: Opportunity_blackmailed_0 [nobr]
Acquiesce... for now


:: Opportunity_blackmailed_0_flavor [nobr]

<p>
Not wanting to put <<rep $g.slaver>> in any peril, you acquiesced to the
demand for now. You'll have to start pooling money for the monthly
installments, if you want to maintain the status quo...
</p>


:: Opportunity_blackmailed_1 [nobr]
Forget it, <<if $g.slaver>><<rep $g.slaver>><</if>> isn't worth it!

<p>
<<if $unit.player.isHasTrait('per_logical')>>
Making up your mind, you coldly tell the messenger that you have no need of
such a <<uadjbad $g.slaver>> slaver anymore, and they can do whatever they
want with the former slaver.
The answer sent chills down the messenger's spine, and <<they
$g.messenger>> almost meekly exited your fort, unnerved by your cold
decision.
<<elseif $unit.player.isHasTrait('per_empath')>>
With a gulp down your throat, you make the painful decision to decline after
weighing <<reps $g.slaver>> utility and the money it would cost you to rescue <<them $g.slaver>>. The
messenger can clearly see the hesitation in your empathetic mind, but decides
not to push it further and exits your fort without a word.
<<else>>
Making up your mind, you tell the messenger that you decide to decline the offer.
The messenger looks almost surprised at your cold answer, but <<they
$g.messenger>> knows how to shut <<their $g.messenger>> mouth and exits your
fort without asking questions.
<</if>>
</p>

<p>
This decision will surely seal <<reps $g.slaver>> fate, and you will never see
<<them $g.slaver>> ever again...
</p>
