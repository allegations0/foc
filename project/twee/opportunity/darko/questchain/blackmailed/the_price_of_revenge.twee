<p>
For the first time, you come face to face with your adversary.
You're the victor in this warfare, and with none of <<their $g.boss>> fellow
slaver in sight, <<they $g.boss>> boss|know it too. Despite the odds being
stacked against <<them $g.boss>>, the still-dignified leader of the slaving
company remains self-possessed despite the situation.
</p>

<p>
"For what it's worth," <<they $g.boss>> boss|say without preamble,
"I had nothing against you. It was all business — a little harmless blackmail
is something you would also do in my position. I never took any sexual
pleasure from your slaver, and <<they $g.slaver>> slaver|remain healthy under my
care."
<<They $g.boss>> boss|look nervous for the first time.
"So, what do we do now? I've amassed enough personal wealth in my fort,
enough to pay you back all the money you've sent over to me and then some.
Let me go. I'll walk away, and I'll give away all the money I have left,
and also <<rep $g.slaver>> of course."
</p>

<<unitcard $g.boss 1>>


:: Opportunity_the_price_of_revenge_0 [nobr]
Accept


:: Opportunity_the_price_of_revenge_0_flavor [nobr]

<p>
You accept, magnanimous in victory.
"I don't think I would have done that," <<they $g.boss>> replies.
"Thank you. I'll not forget this."
</p>

<p>
With that, <<they $g.boss>> left you at the entrance of a hidden door inside
the fort before leaving for good. A wealth of treasure lies behind, no doubt
were saved for when <<they $g.boss>> boss|was planning to retire.
But more importantly, you've also rescued your long-lost slaver.
</p>

<p>
Upon seeing you,
<<rep $g.slaver>>
<<if $g.slaver.isFemale()>>dives<<else>>runs<</if>>
into your <<ubreasts $unit.player>>,
<<if $g.slaver.isHasTrait('per_cautious')>>
sobbing
<<elseif $g.slaver.isHasTrait('per_brave')>>
<<else>>
holding back <<their $g.slaver>> tears while saying
<</if>>
"<<They $g.boss>> made me do such humiliating things...".
You <<uadv $unit.player>> wrap your <<uarms $unit.player>> around <<them
$g.slaver>> in a comforting hug.
True to the former leader's word, <<they $g.slaver>> slaver|look exactly as you
remember, to your great relief.
</p>


:: Opportunity_the_price_of_revenge_1 [nobr]
Refuse and enslave <<if $g.boss>><<them $g.boss>><</if>>


:: Opportunity_the_price_of_revenge_1_flavor [nobr]

<p>
You coldly decline. "That was a mistake," <<they $g.boss>> boss|reply, before
taking a magical scroll and chanting it out loud. As a loud magical sound can be
heard from across the fort, the former leader continues.
"All the remaining valuables in this fort has been teleported away. You'll
get nothing from me." It's true. Even after <<rep $g.dps>> and <<utheirrel
$g.dps $g.healer>> <<rep $g.healer>> scour through the entire fort,
everything of value seems to have gone completely missing.
</p>

<p>
Still, <<rep $g.dps>> makes quick work and soon you are treated to the
delicious moment of finding the former leader on <<their $g.boss>> knees in
front of you with a black bag over <<their $g.boss>> head and <<their $g.boss>>
<<uhands $g.boss>> tied securely
behind <<them $g.boss>>, ready for a long trip home. <<They $g.boss>> boss|is one
of your slaves now, fundamentally no different than any other.
</p>

<p>
As delicious as the sight of a former slave company leader being put in
<<their $g.boss>> place, you are also here to rescue <<rep $g.slaver>>.
Fortunately, <<rep $g.slaver>> slaver|was not teleported away, and after some
scouring <<yourrep $g.dps>> managed to find the <<man $g.slaver>> stowed away in
the basement of the fort.
</p>

<p>

<p>
You will hear back from this in a week from now...
</p>


:: Opportunity_the_price_of_revenge_2 [nobr]

Recruit <<if $g.boss>><<them $g.boss>><</if>> instead


:: Opportunity_the_price_of_revenge_2_flavor [nobr]

<p>
You decline, with a different idea in mind. "That was a mistake," <<they
$g.boss>> boss|reply, before taking a magical scroll and chanting it out.
Realizing your mistake, you immediately try to convey your true message: that
you approve of <<their $g.boss>> doings and would like to recruit <<them
$g.boss>> into your company instead. But by the time your message reaches the <<man
$g.boss>>, it was already too late — many valuables in the fort has been
teleported away.
</p>

<p>
You have to repeat your offer a few times before the thick-headed <<urace
$g.boss>> finally boss|get it. As the former slaver boss realizes <<their $g.boss>> luck, you
can see <<their $g.boss>> dignity returns. "That is incredibly benevolent of
you, but also a very smart decision," <<they $g.boss>> says after a long pause.
Having been rescued from a surefire future of slavery will surely earn you
the loyalty of the slaver, and although <<they $g.boss>> will not lead a
slaving company again, retirement as a slaver is surely much preferable to
that of being a slave.
</p>

<p>
Still, you are also here to rescue <<rep $g.slaver>>.
With <<rep $g.boss>> on your side, you locate your <<man $g.slaver>> quickly
in the basement of the fort. True to <<their $g.boss>> words, your slaver was
relatively untouched, although you can still sense <<their $g.slaver>> hatred
towards your new slaver <<rep $g.boss>>.
</p>
