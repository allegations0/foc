<p>
It is done. You have received the payment for your slavers' efforts in these
past few months. The <<rep setup.item.f_object_master_fuckmachine>> is yours,
to use as you see fit. But what use do you have for such a high-tech machine?
</p>

<p>
First, you can auction it, which will fetch you so much more money compared to if
you were to later sell it in your <<rep setup.buildingtemplate.bazaar>>.
<<set _vice = $dutylist.getUnitIfAvailable('viceleader')>>
<<if _vice>>
Per your vice leader <<reps _vice>> calculation, auctioning it will net you at
least a whopping <<money 70000>>.
<<else>>
If only you have a vice leader that can advise you how much you would get from selling it...
<</if>>
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, if your vanity eclipses your need of money,
you can simply keep the contraption as a rare furniture for one of your bedchambers.
</p>

<p>
Or, if you're feeling particularly degenerate, you can use it to gape all of
your slaves... The fuckmachine will probably break down though from such
misuse, and will be worth nothing afterwards. But your slaves will surely all
end up with permanently gaping holes, for whatever it is that you are planning for them...
</p>

Auction it


:: Opportunity_for_science__mad_science_0_flavor [nobr]

<p>
It is done. The <<rep setup.item.f_object_master_fuckmachine>> has been sold
in one of the most busy auctions ever, with a very loud sequence of bids until
a high noble decided to splurge a silly amount of gold for the contraption.
</p>

<p>
Whatever the noble is planning to do with the <<rep
setup.item.f_object_master_fuckmachine>>, you don't really care as you are
swimming
in your newfound gold. Perhaps you can ask the inventor <<rep $g.inventor>>
for another adventure...
</p>

Keep it


:: Opportunity_for_science__mad_science_1_flavor [nobr]
<p>
Even with so much money being dangled in front of you, you've decided to keep
the prestigious machine for your own company. The <<rep
setup.item.f_object_master_fuckmachine>> is now ready in your fort, to be
installed in some lucky fellow's bedchamber.
</p>

Machine rape your slaves


:: Opportunity_for_science__mad_science_2_flavor [nobr]
<<set _slaves = $company.player.getUnits({job: setup.job.slave})>>
<p>
In a true act of degeneracy, you decided to use the machine to rape all of
your slaves â€” no exceptions.
You form your slaves into a line, with
the unlucky slave <<rep _slaves[0]>> in front of the line. You command <<them
_slaves[0]>> to approach you, before unveiling the <<rep
setup.item.f_object_master_fuckmachine>>. The slaves immediately quiver in
fear of what you are planning to do to them, and they do not have to imagine as
you grabbed <<yourrep _slaves[0]>> and forcefully place <<them _slaves[0]>> atop
the dildo sitting quietly over the machine.
</p>

<p>
Sensing the inviting <<uhole _slaves[0]>> above it, the machine magically
starts its raping procedure, moving its large dildo up and down
<<if _slaves[0].isHasVagina()>>
both of the slave's rear orifices until both gape permanently.
<<else>>
the slave's anus until it becomes a permanent gape.
<</if>>
After a while that must have been excruciatingly long for the slave,
the machine finally release the spent <<rep _slaves[0]>> as
you order the next slave to step onto the machine.
</p>

<p>
Screams can be heard from all around your fort as the machine continues its
mindless rape on your slaves. Once all the slaves are done and gaping, the
machine finally break down, as if sensing that its horrific duties are finally over.
</p>
