<p>
The orcs are simple folks â€” according to their legends, only those foolish
or brave enough are worthy to claim the pole of heavens (which to your
slavers' understanding is just a <<rep setup.item.quest_for_science_stick>>).
Your slavers are given a choice on how to prove their worth.
</p>

<p>
The first option is to go through the Trial of Combat. They must survive the
onslaught of orcish gladiators coming their way until all of the village are
defeated. Given their skills, this is completely within your slaver's
prowess, but they will no doubt sustain great injuries afterwards.
</p>

<p>
The second option is to undergo the Trial by Fire. Here, your slavers must
withstand fiery abuse inflicted by the orcs upon their bodies for an hour straight. Which is
simple enough, but will surely inflict some injury as well as some trauma to
your slavers.
</p>

<p>
Finally, there is the Trial of Darkness, where your slavers must venture
alone to the caverns north of the village in search of the pole of heavens
(which they will awkwardly hide somewhere there). While this sounds easy
enough, legends say that the caverns are cursed, and whoever enter will be
greatly traumatized by the experience...

Trial by combat


:: Opportunity_for_science__the_trial_0_flavor [nobr]
<p>
Choosing the Trial of Combat, <<yourrep $g.tank>> prepared <<their $g.tank>>
<<ubodyall $g.tank>> for the no-doubt abusive fight.
<<Rep $g.healer>> stood at the ready to undo the damage as much as possible,
while <<rep $g.dps>> <<uadv $g.dps>> sharpened <<their $g.dps>> <<uweapon
$g.dps>> for the upcoming onslaught.
</p>

<p>
When the horn was blown, the first wave of orcish warriors came descending down on
slavers. Still full of energy, <<rep $g.tank>> managed to fend off the bulk of
the forces while <<rep $g.dps>> <<uadv $g.dps>> dispatched them one by one,
until all of the first wave is defeated. But your slavers knew that there are many
waves to come, and this was only the beginning.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, your slavers lost count on the number of waves they had
defeated. Wounded (but not dead) bodies were scattered throughout the battlefield, and
your slavers had been badly injured by stray hits by the time they reach the final wave.
The final fight was against the chieftain themself, who charged at your
slavers with the <<rep setup.item.quest_for_science_stick>>, pointing it
menacingly at <<rep $g.tank>>. With the last of <<their $g.tank>> energy,
supported by <<rep
$g.healer>> depleted magic reserve, <<rep $g.tank>> fended off one final attack
before collapsing to the ground. But it was not in vain, as <<yourrep $g.dps>>
managed to use the opening to launch a sneak attack on the chieftain, who was
knocked out in one blow.
With the battle won, <<rep $g.dps>> collapsed to the ground from exhaustion,
leaving only the healer <<rep $g.healer>> to bask in the victory. <<They
$g.healer>> grabbed the <<rep setup.item.quest_for_science_stick>> off the
chieftain's arms, and heaved both slavers back to recover before heading home
to the fort.
</p>

Trial by fire


:: Opportunity_for_science__the_trial_1_flavor [nobr]
<p>
The Trial of Fire began by having all three of your slavers tied to a pole
in the middle of the encampment. As the chieftain raised a blazing torch on
your slavers,
<<rep $g.tank>>
<<if $g.tank.isMasochistic()>>
almost couldn't contain <<their $g.tank>> masochistic excitement at the upcoming pain.
<<elseif $g.tank.isHasTrait('per_brave')>>
bravely steeled <<themself $g.tank>> for the incoming pain.
<<elseif $g.tank.isHasTrait('per_cautious')>>
looked skywards trying not to imagine the excruciating pain about to be
inflicted on <<their $g.tank>> cowardly self.
<<else>>
<<uadv $g.tank>> steeled <<themself $g.tank>> for the upcoming pain.
<</if>>
The orcs seared your slavers, not enough to cause permanent damage, but enough
to injure and inflict as much pain as possible to your slavers. The hour felt
like an eternity as your slavers were seared again and again, in the attempt to
prove their worth. After the grueling hour, the orcs untied your slavers, whom all
collapsed to the ground with heavy injuries and trauma. Still, seeing the braveries
(and mostl foolishness) exhibited by
your slavers, the chieftain kept the promise and handed over the "pole of
heavens" to your slavers' well deserved <<uhands $g.tank>>.

Trial by darkness


:: Opportunity_for_science__the_trial_2_flavor [nobr]

<p>
After your slavers chose the Trial of darkness, they could
see an orc servant scuttled outside of the encampment,
no doubt to hide the <<rep setup.item.quest_for_science_stick>> somewhere inside the caverns.
The next day, your slavers departed for the caverns, led
<<uadv $g.tank>> by <<rep $g.tank>>.
</p>

<p>
It was unclear what transpired inside the caverns, but when your slavers
returned with the <<rep setup.item.quest_for_science_stick>> in <<uhand $g.tank>>,
their eyes were
blank and lifeless. They remained motionless for an hour, until an escort
from the orc encampment found them just standing there and brought them back to the
encampment. Your slavers eventually recovered enough of their wits to return
back to the fort, but the experience had greatly traumatized them.
</p>
