<p>
    You receive many requests from the <<lore region_deep>>. There's the occassional bounty hunting, treasure hunting, or even opportunities to get yourself a new slave.
    One such requests have arrived today: a horde of giant spiders is apparently on the way to some goblin village, and they have urgently requested assistance to repel the invasion.
</p>

<p>
    It all sounds very mundane, until you hear a loud knock on your office door. It's <<rep $g.kobold>>, looking extremely nervous.
    "The village in question was my hometown," <<they $g.kobold>> said, "I heard from the messenger. They're requesting our aid.".
</p>

<p>
    That makes it slightly more complicated. As you recall, the reason why <<rep $g.kobold>> is here to begin with was that the <<urace $g.kobold>> could no longer stand being bullied in that particular village for being different than ordinary kobolds. While you could just save the village â€” you could alternatively help <<rep $g.kobold>> exact revenge by instead ignoring their pleas, and enslave the village survivors instead. But is this what <<rep $g.kobold>> wants to do?
</p>
