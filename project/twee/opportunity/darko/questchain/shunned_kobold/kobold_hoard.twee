<p>
    Apparently, the kobold has always dreamed to have a sizable hoard. You have heard that all kobolds do, in fact, no doubt something they inherited from their dragonkin bloodline. <<Rep $g.kobold>> asked what would you do to amass such a treasure hoard...
</p>




:: Opportunity_kobold_hoard_0 [nobr]
Encourage aggression


:: Opportunity_kobold_hoard_0_flavor [nobr]
<p>
    Taking from others, of course! By force if necessary.
</p>
<p>
    In the coming days, you can see your advice had taken root. <<Rep $g.kobold>> appears more wilful overall, even bordering on being aggressive and rude.
</p>


:: Opportunity_kobold_hoard_1 [nobr]
Encourage patience


:: Opportunity_kobold_hoard_1_flavor [nobr]
<p>
    By patience, of course. Amassing it little by little.
</p>
<p>
    In the coming days, you can see your advice had taken root. <<Rep $g.kobold>> appears more patient overall, willing to bide time in order to get the best out of their situation.
