<p>
Since the beginning of your ownership of <<attach _describe>>, the head whore
<<name $g.head>> had been nothing but a resourceful, helpful <<girl
$g.head>>. In fact, <<they $g.head>> managed to persuade the
<<if _class > 0>> noble <<else>> local mafia boss <</if>> to waive their
<<if _class > 0>> tax <<else>> protection money <</if>> on your establishment
last time. The manager of your brothel, <<yourrep $g.owner>>,
owner|think that <<their $g.head>> talents are wasted working as a simple
whore, and maybe a promotion is appropriate.
</p>

<p>
<<Their $g.head>> negotiation talents as well as <<their $g.head>> smarts make them the perfect fit if you are looking for a business manager to help manage the brothel's growing business. <<They $g.head>> should be able to optimize expenses, which in turn saves you some of the operation costs of your brothel each week.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, <<they $g.head>> head|have also shown <<their $g.head>> shrewdness in dealing with other people, and <<they $g.head>> would make an excellent customer relations officer. <<They $g.head>> would ensure that all the brothel's customer leave the establishment satisfied, which should earn you some amount of favor each week from the grateful citizens of <<lore location_npc>>.

Business manager


:: Opportunity_brothel_promotion_0_flavor [nobr]
<p>
The promotion was done in a simple way, within <<reps $g.owner>> office inside the brothel. From now on, <<name $g.head>> is no longer a whore — <<they $g.head>> is the business manager of the brothel now, and <<they $g.head>> is expected to manage the financials of the establishment.
</p>

<p>
You seem to have chosen well, as <<they $g.head>> set out to work immediately. <<Their $g.head>> work has been exemplary — while the changes look minimal here and there, it adds up, and eventually quite a lot of unnecessary expenses are cut. The "bring-your-own-lube" may have caused a little scandal within the establishment, but a little application of <<their $g.head>> charm and the incident was soon forgotten. It seems that despite being a business manager, <<they $g.head>> has not lost <<their $g.head>> wits and skills.
</p>




:: Opportunity_brothel_promotion_1 [nobr]
Customer relations


:: Opportunity_brothel_promotion_1_flavor [nobr]
<p>
The promotion was done in a simple way, within <<reps $g.owner>> office inside the brothel. From now on, <<name $g.head>> is no longer a whore — <<they $g.head>> is the customer relations of the brothel now, and <<they $g.head>> is expected to ensure all your customers left the establishment with a smile on their faces.
</p>

<p>
You seem to have chosen well, as <<they $g.head>> set out an exemplary work. Whenever a customer looked disappointed, <<they $g.head>> dutifully attend to them, sometimes personally, and made sure their complaints were addressed.
Sometimes, <<they $g.head>> even gives a complimentary blowjob or two. It seems that despite being a customer relations officer, <<they $g.head>> has not lost <<their $g.head>> sexual skills.
