<p>
You have expanded <<attach _describe>>, but there is still space for one more facility in the brothel. You have a choice between building a set of private rooms, or a full-blown sex dungegons.
</p>

<p>
The private rooms would allow guests and the whore of their choice some much-needed privacy, and they can engage in an even more intimate and raunchy actions, including
<<if _sub == 'sub'>>
dominating the whores to their heart content.
<<else>>
allowing themself to be dominated by their chosen whores without anybody knowing.
<</if>>
Having a luxurious rooms such as this will no doubt increase your revenue, and may also increase the classiness of your fine establishment.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, a sex dungeons is made for bondage, and each room will be fully furnished with manacles and other bondage devices.
<<if _sub == 'sub'>>
Paying customers would be able to punish their chosen whores as they see fit — no permanent damage of course.
<<else>>
Your dominant whores would be able to satisfy the darkest desires of the more submissive clients — no permanent damage of course.
<</if>>
Having such an option will no doubt increase your revenue, and also make your brothel appear raunchier than ever...
