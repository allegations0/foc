The former head whore of <<attach _describe>>, that is <<rep $g.head>>, is currently working as the brothel's

business manager. <<They $g.head>> dutifully makes sure that the brothel's financials remains in the green, and ensure that there are no excess expenses leaking from the daily operations. This indirectly increases the brothel's operating profit.

customer relations officer. <<They $g.head>> dutifully makes sure that the customers leave the brothel satisfied. Your company's popularity among the residents of the <<lore location_npc>> increases week by week as a result.

<p>
While <<they $g.head>> head|have been doing a very good job so far, <<yourrep $g.owner>> owner|suggest that it may be time to let <<them $g.head>> switch job.
<<if _promotion == 'money'>>
Instead of a business manager, <<they $g.head>> could be reassigned as the customer relations officer. As a customer relations officer, <<they $g.head>> would then be responsible to ensure that all your customers leave your venue satisfied. In turn, this can increase your company's popularity among the nekos, but in exchange for lowered profit.
<<else>>
Instead of a customer relations officer, <<they $g.head>> could be reassigned as the business manager. <<They $g.head>> would be responsible to ensure that the brothel remains profitable, which directly increases the operating profit. Without a customer relations officer, however, your favor with the nekos will no longer increase week by week.
