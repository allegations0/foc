The <<girl $g.volunteer>> volunteer|look like a dissolute party <<girl $g.volunteer>>. Face to face with the proprietor of the place — you that is — <<they $g.volunteer>> slave|bite <<their $g.volunteer>> lip nervously, and looks to <<name $g.slave>> for guidance. <<name $g.slave>> slave|nod at <<them $g.volunteer>> reassuringly, so <<they $g.volunteer>> explains <<themself $g.volunteer>>.

"<<if $unit.player.isMale()>>Sir<<else>>Ma'am<</if>>, my name is <<name $g.volunteer>>. I'm, um, bored, I guess. I go to brothels and get drunk and fuck
<<if $g.head.isMale()>>guys<<else>>girls<</if>> and it's just kinda boring. But when I go into <<= _name>>, I saw <<name $g.slave>>, and <<they $g.slave>> was just so
<<if _sub == 'dom'>>
dominant and
<<elseif _sub == 'sub'>>
graceful and

skillful and

<<They $g.slave>> seemed so confident in what <<they $g.slave>> was doing and who <<they $g.slave>> was and I talked to <<them $g.slave>> and <<they $g.slave>> said <<they $g.slave>> was your head courtesan and... I want to be like <<them $g.slave>>.
Can I work at <<= _name>>? I'd be good,
I'm good at

dominating others

sucking dicks

and stuff."
<<They $g.volunteer>> seems to be a little naive about whoring, and seemingly completely unaware of your company's actual business, but there's no need to tell <<them $g.volunteer>> that.

Let <<them $g.volunteer>> work in the brothel


:: Opportunity_brothel_volunteer_0_flavor [nobr]
<p>
You accept <<their $g.volunteer>> offer to volunteer, and direct <<name $g.slave>> to begin <<their $g.volunteer>> courtesan training immediately.
Hearing that <<they $g.slave>> will receive <<name $g.volunteer>>'s attention personally, the <<girl $g.volunteer>> visiblly bounces joyfully on <<their $g.volunteer>> heels. Courtesan training will be hard and expensive for you, but later down the road the <<girl $g.volunteer>> becomes quite adept at <<their $g.volunteer>> job, and your brothel's reputation increases as a result.
</p>



:: Opportunity_brothel_volunteer_1 [nobr]
Enslave <<them $g.volunteer>>


:: Opportunity_brothel_volunteer_1_flavor [nobr]
<p>
You accept <<their $g.volunteer>> offer to "volunteer". <<Rep $g.volunteer>> bounces nervously on <<their $g.volunteer>> heels.
Finally <<they $g.volunteer>> volunteer|work up <<their $g.volunteer>> courage and asks,
"Can I work with <<name $g.slave>>?"
You sternly tell <<them $g.slave>> to call you <<Master $unit.player>>, to ask questions only with permission, and to strip. <<They $g.slave>> looks at <<name $g.slave>>, but <<they $g.slave>> slave|return <<their $g.volunteer>> look with no compassion at all and tells <<them $g.volunteer>> to do what you say. Looking suddenly fearful, <<name $g.volunteer>> volunteer|strip. Once your inspection of <<their $g.volunteer>> body reaches <<their $g.volunteer>> anus, <<they $g.volunteer>> volunteer|become suddenly nervous. "A-am I going to have t-to do butt stuff, <<Master $unit.player>>?"
As you finish your inspection on the poor unsuspecting <<girl $g.volunteer>>, you ask <<name $g.slave>> to bring <<them $g.volunteer>> over to the slave pens.
As <<name $g.slave>> slave|restrain the disbelieving <<girl $g.volunteer>>, you tell <<them $g.volunteer>> <<they $g.volunteer>> is your slave now, so <<they $g.volunteer>> can be sure <<they $g.volunteer>> won't be bored. <<They $g.volunteer>> volunteer|release a wail of utter despair, quickly cut off by a sturdy bag being fastened over <<their $g.volunteer>> head.

<p>
Unfortunately, the story of your cruelty spreads within the <<lore location_npc>>, and its citizens view you with some disdain as a result.
