To find out the truth.

<p>
The

watches over them.
They
<<if $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_revenge') == 'revenge'>>
angrily
<<else>>
resolvedly
<</if>>
go to the forest in search of the "sage". Upon seeing them,
the sage morphs into their true form: a pureblood demon who delights
in nothing but seeing mortals squirm.
</p>

<p>
With the help of the trusty mercenary company, the

defeat the evil demon.
The mastermind behind this book's adventure has been defeated, and is now at their mercy.
But the mercenary company implores them to spare the demon, for reasons unknown.
Having been greatly indebted to them, the
<<= $varstore.get('choose_your_own_adventure_lovers')>>
defers the final judgment to the mercenary company leader, but with a twist.
They offer you, the leader of the slaving company above, a choice.
Should you slay the demon, they shall agree to join your company.
But should you choose to spare the demon, they shall depart the land,
never again to be seen...
</p>

<p>
How will you remember this story to end?
Will you slay the demon and recruit the

Slay the demon

<p>
The deed is done. The demon lays dead as their remains vanishes into thin air.
</p>

<p>
Their journey finally at an end, and they are eager to begin their new life
â€” as your slavers if you deem them fit for the job.
</p>

Take "pity" on the demon

<p>
As you inform them of your decisions, they take it with great difficulty, but do not complain.
</p>

<p>
Some time later, you receive a farewell letter from them as they voyage
southwards into the <<lore region_sea>>, to never be seen again by your company.
You read the letter with nostalgia as you pet your new demonic slave, who
will surely fetch a large sum in the market should you wish to sell <<them $g.demon>>.
