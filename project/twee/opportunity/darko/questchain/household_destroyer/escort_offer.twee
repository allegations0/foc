:: Opportunity_escort_offer2 [nobr]
<p>
    After your previous reports of a certain drow royal causing entire households to get subbified, the rulers of <<rep $company.drow>> has contacted your company to discretely "dispose" of said royal.
    The subby household issue has become a rather real problem, and they have decided that the best solution for now is to make the drow move out of the city.
</p>

<p>
    Of course they can't simply exile such a high ranking drow from the city. On paper, the drow royal will simply be offered a rare vacation into the vast world above ground.
    <<They $g.drow>> will be given a sufficient amount of money to spend <<their $g.drow>> time luxuriously above.
</p>

<p>
    The only issue is that someone needs to escort the drow into the surface, a job which has been offered to you. The drow promises money and favor in exchange for the task. However, should you accept, whoever you send as escorts will likely spend a prolonged amount of time with the drow, and should they be of weak mind, who knows what might happen to them...
</p>


:: Opportunity_escort_offer2_0 [nobr]
Accept



:: Opportunity_escort_offer2_1 [nobr]
Refuse


:: Opportunity_escort_offer2_1_flavor [nobr]
<p>
    Given just how dominant the drow had been all these time, you figured that it might simply be too risky to send a group of your slavers to escort the dominant to the surface. Some other slaving company shall do it, and the drow shall become their business and never again yours.
