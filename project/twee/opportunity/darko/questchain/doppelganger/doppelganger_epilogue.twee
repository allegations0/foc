:: Opportunity_doppelganger_epilogue [nobr]
<p>
Having healed the trauma that your doppelganger <<rep $g.dop>> had from being violated by a desert pirate, <<they $g.dop>> had finally stopped involuntarily transforming every night. You made sure of this by watching <<them $g.dop>> for a week, and indeed, the <<rep $g.slaver>> lookalike now slept peacefully every such night.
</p>

<p>
With the threat over, it's time to decide what to do with the doppelganger for good. You can of course, reclaim the bounty placed on <<their $g.dop>> head, although this will for sure make <<rep $g.slaver>> a little grumpy. Alternatively, you could let <<them $g.dop>> keep staying at your fort as your guest, as if nothing changed. Finally, now that <<their $g.dop>> mind is no longer switching every now and then, you could try to recruit <<them $g.dop>> into being one of your slavers. Having a perfect clone of <<rep $g.slaver>> would surely be beneficial for your company, no?
</p>




:: Opportunity_doppelganger_epilogue_0 [nobr]
Fulfill bounty


:: Opportunity_doppelganger_epilogue_0_flavor [nobr]
<p>
Money is the most important thing for you, and you made the decision to sell the doppelganger away and fulfill <<their $g.dop>> bounty. <<Rep $g.slaver>> slaver|is a little saddened at the departure of <<their $g.slaver>> friend, but you have no doubt <<they $g.slaver>> will quickly get over it with a couple of drinks or two.
</p>


:: Opportunity_doppelganger_epilogue_1 [nobr]
Let <<them $g.dop>> stay


:: Opportunity_doppelganger_epilogue_1_flavor [nobr]
<p>
With the threat over, there is no reason for you to not let <<them $g.dop>> continue to stay at your fort. This has a positive effect on <<rep $g.slaver>> â€” somehow, having a doppelganger of yourself around seems to make <<them $g.slaver>> recover more quickly from injuries, as if any injury they suffer is divided into two.
</p>




:: Opportunity_doppelganger_epilogue_2 [nobr]
Recruit <<them $g.dop>>


:: Opportunity_doppelganger_epilogue_2_flavor [nobr]
<p>
In your infinite wisdom, you've decided to recruit a doppelganger into your employ. <<They $g.dop>> will take up the form of <<rep $g.slaver>>, and unfortunately, <<they $g.dop>> might not be able to change <<their $g.dop>> form at will, given <<their $g.dop>> circumstances. Still, when properly trained, <<they $g.dop>> may be able to relearn a trick or two that would allow them to morph back into the exact likeliness of <<rep $g.slaver>> every few weeks, reverting all corruptions in the process.
</p>
