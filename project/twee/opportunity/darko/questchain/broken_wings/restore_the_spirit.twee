<<set _u = setup.getAnySlaver()>>

<p>
Having obtained the essence of spirit, it is time to return it to your
broken slave <<rep $g.slave>>. But perhaps there is something you'd like to
do first?
</p>


:: Opportunity_restore_the_spirit_0 [nobr]
Bless with diligence


:: Opportunity_restore_the_spirit_0_flavor [nobr]
<p>
The stone begins to emit a faint blue glow as you press it into <<reps $g.slave>>
<<ubreasts $g.slave>> â€” the essence flowing from within into <<their
$g.slave>> limbs. Eventually the stone is reduced to nothingness, and while
there does not seem to be anything that have changed about <<yourrep $g.slave>>, you
can see <<their $g.slave>> limbs colors changing into a livelier shade of color. Surely
this is the correct path to restoring <<their $g.slave>> spirit?
</p>


:: Opportunity_restore_the_spirit_1 [nobr]
Corrupt the essence


:: Opportunity_restore_the_spirit_1_flavor [nobr]
<<set _u = $company.player.getUnits({job: setup.job.slaver}).filter(u => u.isHasTrait('magic_dark'))[0]>>
<<if _u>>
<p>
Without any specific reason,
<<if _u.isYou()>>
using your
mastery over <<rep setup.trait.magic_dark>>,
you begin to chant corruption magic, pushing it all into the stone.
<<else>>
you ask <<yourrep _u>> to use <<their _u>>
mastery over <<rep setup.trait.magic_dark>> to corrupt the stone.
<</if>>
Within moments, the once clear-blue stone begins to darken, and purple swirls
can be seen from inside. Satisfied, you then press the stone into <<rep
$g.slave>>, whose body visibly absorbs the corrupted essence. It's unclear
what effect this have, but once the essence is entirely absorbed, the change
in <<their $g.slave>> physique is apparent. <<Their $g.slave>> limbs are
healthier now, although you can see traces of evil emanating from <<therace
$g.slave>>...
</p>
<</if>>
