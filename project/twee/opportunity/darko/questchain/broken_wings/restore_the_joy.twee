<<set _u = setup.getAnySlaver()>>

<p>
A stone powerful enough to turn an evil, vindictive witch into a caring woman
â€” this must be the essence of kindness that once belonged to <<rep $g.slave>>.
It is time for the essence to perhaps return to its owner...
</p>


:: Opportunity_restore_the_joy_0 [nobr]
Bless with kindness


:: Opportunity_restore_the_joy_0_flavor [nobr]

<p>
Reddish light begins to shine brighly from inside the sphere as you bring it
closer to <<yourrep $g.slave>>. Once pressed again <<their $g.slave>>
<<ubreasts $g.slave>>, you can see the stone visibly melts, being absorbed
into the slave's heart until it is swallowed entirely. Immediately the
slave's complexion begins to shift from pure pale to a livelier color, as if
<<their $g.slave>> heart works better now that it is filled with kindness.
Perhaps this is the correct path to eventually unlocking the slave's
true personality...
</p>


:: Opportunity_restore_the_joy_1 [nobr]
Corrupt the essence


:: Opportunity_restore_the_joy_1_flavor [nobr]
<<set _u = $company.player.getUnits({job: setup.job.slaver}).filter(u => u.isHasTrait('magic_dark'))[0]>>
<<if _u>>
<p>
This world does not need kindness, and you are doing the slave's a service by
<<if _u.isYou()>>
personally using your mastery over <<rep setup.trait.magic_dark>> to corrupt the stone.
<<else>>
asking <<yourrep _u>> to use <<their _u>> mastery over <<rep setup.trait.magic_dark>> to corrupt the stone.
<</if>>
The once reddish stone soon turns dark purple, and once it's fully corrupted,
you return to the slave's cell. Pressing the stone onto <<their $g.slave>>
<<ubreasts $g.slave>>, the slave lets out a moan as the stone slowly dissolves
into them, spreading the corrupted essence directly into <<their $g.slave>>
heart. With the stone entirely absorbed, the slave's complexion starts to
shift from entirely pale into a livelier color, although you can sense trace
of malice here and there from the slave's body...
