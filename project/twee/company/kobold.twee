<p>
Among the many <<lore race_kobold>> communities in the <<lore region_deep>>, the kobolds of
<<lore location_drak_xoth>> are perhaps the most numerous.
The city's leadership essentially falls into their spiritual leader, the archpriest
residing in the <<lore location_gaiatal>>.
</p>

<p>
Drak Xoth kobolds often send expeditions into the vast unknown of the <<lore region_deep>>.
Whenever an expedition is successful, they would celebrate by sending gifts to their allies.
Should you manage to befriend these kobolds, expect them to gift you random gifts every few weeks.
