:: CompanyTemplateNeko [nobr]

The catfolk of the <<lore region_forest>>. Most have lost their fully furry ancestries,
and mostly just sport cat ears and cat tails.
Many can be found peddling in sex toys, and if you befriend them, they might be
willing to sell their wares at your fort.
Rumors have it that they sell the rarest of their toys to their most staunch allies...
