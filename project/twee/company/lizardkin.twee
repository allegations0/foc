:: CompanyTemplateLizardkin [nobr]

A group of people with scaley skin and enormous tails living
across the <<lore region_sea>>.
Unlike the purebred dragonkin, these people lack wings, but they make up for it
in grit and combat ferocity.
These people are not usually welcoming to outsiders, but for those who managed
to secure their trust, they will find that lizardkin scouts are one of the best
scouts for finding rare quests in the world...
