:: CompanyTemplateHumanKingdom [nobr]

The glorious Kingdom of Tor, ruled over by Gaius the Just is perhaps
the most multicultural of all the nations on <<lore continent_main>>.
The <<lore race_humankingdom>> people are industrious, forward thinking, and are
known for their inventiveness and machinery.  Although slavery has recently been
made illegal by royal decree, the practise still exists just under the thin
veneer of civilisation.
Gaining the favour of the Kingdom will provide you with an influx of mercenaries, especially those whose skills have recently been outlawed.
