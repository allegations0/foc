:: CompanyTemplateHumanKingdom [nobr]

The glorious Kingdom of Tor, ruled over by <<lore person_gaius>> is perhaps
the most multicultural of all the nations on <<lore geo_mestia>>.
The <<lore race_humankingdom>> people are industrious, forward thinking, and are
known for their inventiveness and machinery.  Although slavery has recently been
made illegal by royal decree, the practice still exists just under the thin
veneer of civilization.
Gaining the favor of the Kingdom will provide you with an influx of mercenaries, especially those whose skills have recently been outlawed.
