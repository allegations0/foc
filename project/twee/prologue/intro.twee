<p>
After scouring away and far from your old home, you found yet another abandoned fort
to establish your new company at.
It seems there are quite a bit of abandoned forts in the area, and you are not very sure why.
</p>

<p>
Like before, the fort would need a lot of repairs to be worthy to be called as the stronghold
of your glorious company, rebuilding and clearing debris will take time
but as you have demonstrated in the past, it can be done.
There is a lot of work to do, but you are eager to begin straight away...
</p>

<<if !setup.unitgroup.new_game_plus_slaves.isEmpty()>>
<p>
Until you build the <<rep setup.buildingtemplate.veteranhall>>,
the slaves you've brought along from your old fort will be stowed away safely
in one of the dungeons you had already paid for in advance.
</p>
<</if>>

<<else>>

<p>
You did it! You have found an old abandoned fort to establish as the base of operation
for your company: <<rep $company.player>>.
</p>

<p>
The fort is in a sorry state however, most of the buildings are in ruins and debris limits the available space.
There is much to be done before you can even
begin operation as a proper slaver band.
The first improvement you should construct is the
<<rep setup.buildingtemplate.scouthut>>, which allows your group of slavers
to take on more quests on the wild.
Next, you need to build the <<rep setup.buildingtemplate.dungeons>> to house your slaves, and
<<rep setup.buildingtemplate.slavepens>> to temporarily keep incoming slaves.
You also need to expand the <<rep setup.buildingtemplate.lodgings>> if you ever want to hire more slavers.
All in all, aim to build the <<rep setup.buildingtemplate.greathall>> as soon as possible.
</p>

<p>
You open the gates to your new fort and begin your new career...
</p>

<<if !setup.unitgroup.new_game_plus_slaves.isEmpty()>>
<p>
(You get the feeling that some slaves you are destined to receive will
somehow be received once you build the <<rep setup.buildingtemplate.veteranhall>>.)
