      A few days later, a large crate was delivered to your fort, from somewhere in the Deepworld.
      Inside was two slaves, or rather, one slave, ${slave.rep()} and also a completely unresponsive ${slaver.rep()}.
      It seems the demon had seen it fit to punish your slaver for trying to offer
      ${setup.Text.replaceUnitMacros(`demon|them a slave in such a state.
      Fortunately for you, gambler|reps mind seems fixable, given enough time to rest...`,

      From the gateway, ${slave.rep()} was seemingly returned, launched headfirst onto the floor.
      But upon closer inspection, the slave was a completely different person that your original slave.
      They look absolutely similar in physical appearance, but this one is not mindbroken.
      However,
      the slave is completely devoid of any emotion or personality, just like a doll...
      Unnerving.

      Even from afar, ${setup.Text.replaceUnitMacros(`gambler|rep`, { gambler: slaver })} could feel power emanating from the demon -- this must be one
      of the most powerful demons to reside within the plane.
      The demon has offered to join your company, out of pure curiosity
      on how you managed to obtain your hands on such a valuable slave.
      Even before you decide whether to accept or refuse, the demon has already marked
      ${slave.rep()} permanently, tainting the slave with a demonic brand marking
      ${slave.rep()} as the demon's property for all eternity.
