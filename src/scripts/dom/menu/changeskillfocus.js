        <p>
        Skill focus is the priority skill that the unit will try to focus on.
        These skills will always increase whenever the unit gains a level.
        Set the skill focus according to which skills the unit is talented at!

        <b>Details</b>:
        If a skill is one of the skill focuses, then it is guaranteed to gain at least one point per
        level up.
        However, they can sometimes gain more than one point:
        Each skill focus grants a ${(setup.SKILL_FOCUS_MULTI_INCREASE_CHANCE * 100).toFixed(0)}% chance
        the skill will get another extra point at level up.
        You can select the same skills multiple times as a skill focus, which will increase the chance further.
        For example,
        ${setup.skill.brawn.rep()}${setup.skill.brawn.rep()}${setup.skill.arcane.rep()}
        means the unit will always gain
        ${setup.skill.brawn.rep()}${setup.skill.arcane.rep()}
        on level up.
        It has roughly
        ${setup.DOM.Util.help(html`
          Each skill focus chance is calculated independently. So
          [${setup.skill.brawn.rep()}${setup.skill.brawn.rep()}${setup.skill.arcane.rep()}]
          means that there are two chances, each with
          ${(setup.SKILL_FOCUS_MULTI_INCREASE_CHANCE * 100).toFixed(0)}% probability,
          that the unit will get an extra
          ${setup.skill.brawn.rep()}
          point.
          This means there is a small chance the unit will get
          ${setup.skill.brawn.rep()}${setup.skill.brawn.rep()}${setup.skill.brawn.rep()}
          during one level up.
        `)}
        ${(2 * setup.SKILL_FOCUS_MULTI_INCREASE_CHANCE * 100).toFixed(0)}%
        chance to get
        an extra ${setup.skill.brawn.rep()} point, and
        ${(setup.SKILL_FOCUS_MULTI_INCREASE_CHANCE * 100).toFixed(0)}% chance to get
        an extra ${setup.skill.arcane.rep()} point.
        The order of the skill focuses does not matter.
        Note that a unit always gain six skill points on level up -- the remaining points
        after the skill focuses are assigned to random skills.
