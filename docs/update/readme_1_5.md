[(Feature / Fetish list)](https://gitgud.io/darkofocdarko/fort-of-chains/-/blob/master/docs/faq.md#does-this-game-contain-insert-fetish-here)

FoC v1.5 is the largest update to the game by far, adding a silly amount of content in
**85 new quests** (!!!), **43 new mails**, **131 new events**, as well as more than 100 new portraits.
To compare with this, v1.4 added 21 new quests, 7 mails and 23 events.
The amount of content added in v1.5 is more than quadruple the ones added in v1.4.
Furthermore, content is not the only things added in this version, and several
new smaller features are also added. They are listed at the end of this write-up.

The game engine and feature-set is already complete, and
the focus of this game starting from v1.4 has been to **support contributors** who wants to add content into the game.
This does not change with v1.5.
You are invited too! See details [here](https://gitgud.io/darkofocdarko/fort-of-chains#how-to-contribute-content).

A summary (but still ridiculously long list) of all the changes in v1.5 are listed at the end, but the biggest changes in v1.5 are:

- **Gigantic amount of content**: 83 new quests, 43 new mails, 131 new events, 1 new duty, 1 new interaction, 14 new traits, 2 new buildings, 16 new items, 9 new equipments, 23 new titles, 5 new lore entries, 6 new sex actions, 167 new portraits, 1 duty
- **Subraces**: Proper support for subrace, as well as four new ones in fairy, angel, lizardkin, and demonkin
- **Second person**: Player character is now properly referred to in second person: "you", "yours", etc, which should help increase immersion
- **Text polish**: A proofreading pass were made for all the 400+ quests, 100+ mails, and 150+ events, fixing a silly amount of bugs, inconsistencies, typos, as well as rewriting some stories to increase the overall writing quality.
- **Other new features**: Party, Resistant slaves, Side-bar

Many thanks to the contributors and people who have helped with this project, including:
- Writers: Alberich, Milk Maid Sona, Da_Shem, Blueflame451, Quiver, Innoxia (Lilith's Throne), FCdev, Atacama, Dporentel, Fos, Kyiper, Thavil, Zerutti, anonymouse21212, Anon
- Coders: Naraden, alarmedcat, Arkerthan, and sssk
- Others: acciabread, RikuAotsuki, AbleCharlie, gorbo1, Anu, nezzanine, ChristianS, bug reporters, as well as Patreon tippers

**FoC is always open for more contributors**,
be it writers, proofreaders, programmers, artists, or even discord moderation help!
Unlike most other games, to add content into the game, you **do not have to write code at all**.
This is since the game came shipped with an **in-game GUI tool** for adding content.
More details [here](https://gitgud.io/darkofocdarko/fort-of-chains#how-to-contribute-content).

v1.5 marks **five months** since the inception of this game. As of this version, around thirty people
has helped contribute directly into the game, and I am very grateful for their help. My hope is that one day,
the game can be community-led, where I am nothing but a regular contributor for the project.
