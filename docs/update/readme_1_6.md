FoC v1.6 adds new content, new features, as well as many Engine work and QoL changes.
It's quite large, to put it mildly, so I hope you will enjoy them.

A summary (although given its length its still pretty much an essay) of all the changes from v1.5 to v1.6 are listed at the end, but the biggest new additions in v1.6 are:

- **Content galore**: 31 new quests, 16 new mails, 1 new interaction, 72 new events, 132 new traits, 7 new buildings, 27 new items, 6 new equipments, 18 new titles, 11 new lore entries, 13 new sex actions, 79 new portraits.
- **UI and QoL galore**: Almost all menus have their UI rewritten to make it look and flow better. Also improves performance and error-reporting somewhat
- **Perks and retirement**: You can assign perks to slavers at certain levels, as well as retire them instead of dismissing them.
- **New game plus and epilogue**: You can continue your story ad infinitum now, if you wish. Comes shipped with an epilogue too.
- **Dynamic texts**: Many quests and events in the game now have varying texts depending on who participates in them.
- **Other new features**: Specialists, Blessing, Curse, Skill boost, Contact units, In-Game Database

The game engine and the feature-set of Fort of Chains are already complete, and
the focus of this game starting from v1.4 has been to **support contributors** who wants to add content into the game.
This does not change with v1.5 or v1.6.

**FoC is always open for more contributors**,
be it writers, proofreaders, programmers, artists, or even discord moderation help!
Unlike most other games, to add content into the game, you **do not have to write code at all**.
This is since the game came shipped with an **in-game GUI tool** for adding content.
More details [here](https://gitgud.io/darkofocdarko/fort-of-chains#how-to-contribute-content).

v1.6 marks a little after **six months** since the inception of this game. As
of this version, around thirty-five people have helped contribute directly
into the game, and I am very grateful for their help. My hope is that one
day, the game can be community-led, where I am nothing but a regular
contributor for the project.
