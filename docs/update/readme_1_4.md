FoC v1.4 follows after the extra-large [v1.3 update](https://gitgud.io/darkofocdarko/foc/-/blob/master/docs/update/readme_1_3.md),
which was released three weeks ago.
And oh boy v1.4 would not lose in term of update size:
v1.4 introduces many new content and features,
including lover relationship, subraces, multi-training, and potion shop. But on top of that,
v1.4 introduces the largest feature in the entire game by far: **Interactive Sex**.
You can now have interactive sex with both slavers and slaves now, where you get to choose what to do at
each step. For example, you can begin with some foreplay: kissing, etc, before stripping and get into raunchier
positions.

This gigantic feature in particular comes shipped with:
- **136** new sex actions, many have variations depending on various factors such as traits, mood, location, etc
- **Sex AI**, which depends on the unit's predisposition, goals, permissions, traits, etc.
- Unlockable **Sex Manuals**, including many new events that unlocks those
- Sex pose / bodypart / position system
- Support for first-person text

Many texts in this new feature are borrowed and heavily modified from the
[Lilith's Throne game](https://lilithsthrone.blogspot.com/) by [Innoxia](https://subscribestar.adult/innoxia).
Do give Lilith's Throne game a try, as it is also completely free!
Legal stuffs: Lilith's Throne is released under
[this license](https://github.com/Innoxia/liliths-throne-public/blob/master/license.md).
While Lilith's Throne creator, Innoxia, has given her permission for the texts to be used in this game,
she in no way offer her endorsement for this game.

v1.4 marks a milestone where the [issues list](https://gitgud.io/darkofocdarko/foc/-/issues) no longer
contains any major todo, and most of the remaining todos are QoL and content todos.
This means that the main focus should start to shift into **supporting writers** who wants to add content into the game.
You are invited too! See details [here](https://gitgud.io/darkofocdarko/foc#how-to-contribute-content).

A summary of all the changes in v1.4 are listed at the end, but the biggest changes in v1.4 are:

- **Content**: 21 new quests, 7 new mails, 1 new interaction, 23 new events, 3 new buildings, 22 new items, 2 new equipments, 10 new titles, 136 new sex actions (thanks to Innoxia, Fos, Quiver, Thavil, anonymouse21212, Anon)
- **Interactive Sex**: Have interactive sex with your slavers and slaves in several locations
- **New features**: Lovers, subrace, multi-training, potion shop
- **Engine work**: The game is now based on a modified SugarCube 2, which among other things allow error logs to finally be shown in the fullest, making debugging much faster (thanks to Arkerthan and Naraden)

Many thanks to the contributors to this project, and especially to Naraden and acciabread.

**FoC is always looking for contributors**,
be it writers, programmers, artists, or even moderation help!
Unlike most other games, to add content into the game, you **do not have to write code at all**.
This is since the game came shipped with an **in-game GUI tool** for
adding content.
More details [here](https://gitgud.io/darkofocdarko/foc#how-to-contribute-content).
As of v1.4, there has been over twenty contributors who directly contributed into the project,
while many other have helped by either reporting bugs or spreading the word.
