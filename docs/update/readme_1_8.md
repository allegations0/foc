FoC v1.8 adds a new region in the Deeprealm, as well as many new content, some new features, and so on.
Big thanks to all the contributors who had made this version possible! (Please check below
for a list of the helpful contributors.)

On the development side, FoC v1.8 adds a deployment guide.
As darko is going to be busy,
the goal of the deployment guide is to make it as easy
as possible for the community to continue the development of Fort of Chains in darko's absence,
as well for other people to make and release their own version of FoC.
The game is under a permissive license (except for the assets, which are generally under
creative commons), so you are encouraged to continue and develop the game in whatever way you
like!
Please check out the discord for more information.

If you enjoy the game, make sure to thank the many contributors and people who have helped with this project! The project could not reach this version without them.

At this point, FoC can be already considered **complete**.
However, contributors are still adding more content into the game at their leisure.

**FoC is always open for more contributors**,
be it writers, proofreaders, programmers, artists, or even discord moderation help!
Unlike most other games, to add content into the game, you **do not have to write code at all**.
This is since the game came shipped with an **in-game GUI tool** for adding content.
