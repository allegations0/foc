FoC v1.7 is a very large update that adds new content, new features, and many more.
Many of the new content are done by contributors, including Matthew Lang (who did a big chunk of work this update),
Fae, Choker Guy, Hydrys, and much more (there is a list below),
so if you like their work, please show your appreciation! It will make their day for sure.

Among the many features added in v1.7, the biggest one has to be the complete revamp of the game's
main progression mechanic.
In place of the previous fort-upgrading mechanic,
we now have a proper base-building mechanic over 2d-grid. This comes shipped with 650 different images
for the building, as well as proper path-finding algorithm to find the shortest path between rooms.
They have been quite polished and tested by the many volunteers in the
[Discord server](https://discord.gg/PTD9D7mZyg).

While base-building was the biggest addition in v1.7, it also comes shipped with a very large amount
of other improvements.
A summary (still very long) of all the changes from v1.6 to v1.7 are listed at the end,
but the biggest new additions in v1.7 are:

- **Content galore**: xxx, with a good chunk written by contributor Matthew Lang. A good chunk of existing content are also polished and rewritten for readability
- **Base-building**: A fully featured base-building mechanic to make sure that your progress over the game is literally visible.
- **Content Creator QoL Overhaul**: Thanks to the feedbacks over at the Discord Server, the Content Creator is more user friendly than ever. Tooltips over the toolbar, syntax checking, auto-indentation, and more!
- **Content images**: The game now fully supports adding images to accompany quests / events / etc.
The images are gender-aware, meaning that many has variations depending on the gender of the participating units.
v1.7 ships with 85 of these images.
- **Other new features**: Activities, speech bubbles, negative titles, built-in image packs

If you enjoy the game, make sure to thank the many contributors and people who have helped with this project! The project could not reach this version without them.

The game engine and the feature-set of Fort of Chains are already complete, and
the focus of this game starting from v1.4 has been to **support contributors** who wants to add content into the game.
This does not change with v1.5, v1.6 or v1.7.

**FoC is always open for more contributors**,
be it writers, proofreaders, programmers, artists, or even discord moderation help!
Unlike most other games, to add content into the game, you **do not have to write code at all**.
This is since the game came shipped with an **in-game GUI tool** for adding content.
More details [here](https://gitgud.io/darkofocdarko/fort-of-chains#how-to-contribute-content).

By v1.7, more than forty people have helped
contribute directly into the game, and I am very grateful for their help.
My hope is that one day, the game can be community-led, where I am nothing but a regular
contributor for the project.
