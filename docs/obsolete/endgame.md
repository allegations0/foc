## Level Guide

This game has a clear cut separation between what is called "early game" and "late game".

The early game covers when slaver level is between 1 and 40.
In general, this is before the Veteran Hall is constructed.
Money and EXP gain are slightly lower, but levels are gained at a rapid pace --- almost one
level per quest.
When making low level quests (quest under level 40), keep this in mind.
Once the veteran hall is build, all low level quests will immediately start giving better rewards,
but it has no effect of high level quests.

The late game begins when Veteran Hall is built. You can now assume that the slavers are level
40+, and that the veteran hall has been built.
This means all basic buildings are already at the player's disposal, and quests can use this to
be more creative.
In addition, slaver level will be soft-capped at around level 50.
End-game quest should aim to provide depth and mostly cosmetics reward --- avoid giving reward
that boost income.
Gold income should remain steady after end-game and not jump extremely high out of the sudden.
