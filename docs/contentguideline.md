## Content Guidelines

This game is envisioned to be a community project, and the content guidelines try to be as permissive as possible.
However, there are some exceptions due to various reasons.

#### No content involving incest, necrophilia, bestiality, or minors depicted in sexual acts.

This game utilizes many platforms that ban these specific contents.

#### Soften the "kill" word and no excessive violence

The "kill" word is a turn-off for many players. It is suggested to soften it,
e.g., using "defeat" or do the killing off-screen.

#### No modern guns

The game takes place in a medieval era.
Magic, sword, and first generation machineries are abound, but there shouldn't be
cars, mobile phones, or modern guns.

#### Content for submissive players should be appropriate restricted

The game welcomes content for player characters with the submissive trait.
These content should be restricted only to players whose player character have the submissive trait,
or better yet have variations depending on whether the player character is submissive or not.
Example [here](project/twee/interaction/Quiver/give_oral.twee), by contributor Quiver.

#### Feel free to expand the lore

If your story needs a new piece of lore, feel free to add it to the game!
Consider also adding a [lore entry](project/twee/lore).
It is good not to conflict with the existing lore, to make a believable world.

#### Feel free to add new NON-PLAYABLE races

Non-playable races can be continuously added to the game, however they will remain non-playable.
The current set of ten playable races is final, and will not increase.
If you have some lore behind the race, consider adding a [lore entry](project/twee/lore/race.twee)
for them.
See [here](https://gitgud.io/darkofocdarko/fort-of-chains/-/blob/master/docs/faq.md#new-races) for information about
playable races.
