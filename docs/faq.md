## If I upgrade the game version, can I play with an existing save?

Yes, starting from v1.5.3.4. If you have a save made with a version older than that,
then no.

## Does this game plays on mobile devices?

Sometimes. It sometimes does not work on Android, because Android would not load images from local files.
You can try [here](https://darkofoc.itch.io/fort-of-chains) to see if it loads.

## Can you play as a submissive character in this game?

No.

...you can, but it is not supported at all. There will be no content for you if you do so.

The reason for this decision is as follows. The game overall theme hinges on the theme
that you are leading a band of slavers. This sets the overall tone of the game to refer
to you as a dominant. Allowing player to act submissively will require a special writing,
which will drastically **slow down** development.

The game has a little support if you want to be "secretly submissive", however.
But it is also still lacking, and contributors are welcome to add to this.
See [here](https://gitgud.io/darkofocdarko/fort-of-chains/-/blob/master/project/twee/interaction/Quiver/give_oral.twee#L38) for an example.

so if the feature you ask is not
inside this table, then it is unlikely to be implemented. Exceptions (if any)
are listed [here](https://gitgud.io/darkofocdarko/fort-of-chains/-/issues).

      Gender-swapping is available for slaves and NPCs, but not for slavers.
      Allowing slaver's gender to switch on the fly is causing maintenance issues

      Cosmetic customization

    <td>
      E.g., hair color, blemishes, etc.
      Not planned to be implemented due to clashing with unit portraits, as
      well as making the game more complicated for no good reason.
      It's better that these cosmetic features are represented by the unit's
      portrait instead.
      Not to be confused with skin traits such as having werewolf ears.

The bar for adding new features into the game is very high, because every new feature will introduce
maintenance cost and writing cost. These slow down development.

## Images does not appear?

If you are playing on Android, this is a known issue. The game does not fully support Android,
some players have reported success using either of the following methods:

1. Try [playing the game directly from your browser](https://darkofoc.itch.io/fort-of-chains)

2. Try downloading the game to your device directly, not to your SD card

3. Try opening your game via file:///sdcard/ instead (if it's stored on your device's SD card)

4. As a last resort, in mobile devices some people reported success using the Joiplay emulator

If you are migrating a save from Itch.io into another version, you should instead reset
the unit portraits by going to `Settings`, then `(Reset unit portraits)`.

## New traits?

See [here](https://gitgud.io/darkofocdarko/fort-of-chains/-/blob/master/docs/content.md#traits) for more information.

## New races?

A unit has both a **primary race**, and a **subrace**.
For example, a werewolf unit's primary race is `wolfkin`,
and its subrace is `werewolf`.

**The list of seven playable primary races are final.**
There are seven playable **primary races** in the game: humans, wolfkins,
elves, catkins, greenskins, lizardkins, and demons.
There are no plan to add more fully-playable primary races.
Writers can rest assured that as long as their writing covers all these
seven races, their writing will forever be good.

Non-playable races can be added continuously, however.

#### Subrace

Unlike the primary races, if there are enough content support,
**subraces** can be added in the future.
If you want to do this, be prepared to demonstrate a tremendous
amount of effort, commitment, and dedication. This is because subraces
still incur a large amount of maintenance cost going forward, and hence
will only be added when some contributors are really supporting the addition.

Existing subraces examples:

- [Tigerkin](https://gitgud.io/darkofocdarko/fort-of-chains/-/blob/master/project/twee/unitpool/race/tigerkin.twee): Catkin with fully furry body
- [Fairy](https://gitgud.io/darkofocdarko/fort-of-chains/-/blob/master/project/twee/unitpool/race/fairy.twee): Elf with butterfly wings
- [Angel](https://gitgud.io/darkofocdarko/fort-of-chains/-/blob/master/project/twee/unitpool/race/angel.twee): Human with feathery wings
- [Dragonkin](https://gitgud.io/darkofocdarko/fort-of-chains/-/blob/master/project/twee/unitpool/race/dragonkin.twee): Lizarkin with wings

Here are the full requirements to add a new subrace to the game:

- Write out the [basic trait information](https://gitgud.io/darkofocdarko/fort-of-chains/-/blob/master/project/twee/trait/subrace.twee)

- Write out the [flavor texts for the race](https://gitgud.io/darkofocdarko/fort-of-chains/-/blob/master/project/twee/trait/_texts.twee#L9)

- Write out the [full trait preferences](https://gitgud.io/darkofocdarko/fort-of-chains/-/blob/master/project/twee/unitpool/race/tigerkin.twee)

- Write out the [unit groups](https://gitgud.io/darkofocdarko/fort-of-chains/-/tree/master/project/twee/unitgroup/race)

- At least 20 new images, 10 of each gender. If your subrace is commonly encountered, this should be even higher, which can go up to 100 images (50 per gender) (see lizardkin for example). If your subrace is extremely rare (like tigerkins), 20 is enough. Make sure to follow [image guide](https://gitgud.io/darkofocdarko/fort-of-chains/-/blob/master/docs/images.md#adding-new-portraits-to-the-repository) for these portraits.

- [Nameset](https://gitgud.io/darkofocdarko/fort-of-chains/-/tree/master/src/scripts/names)

- Lore. Come up with a believeable lore for the subrace, written down. [Example](https://gitgud.io/darkofocdarko/fort-of-chains/-/blob/master/project/twee/lore/race.twee#L22) (can be much longer)

- Bodypart text: come up with texts for the bodyparts. [Example](https://gitgud.io/darkofocdarko/fort-of-chains/-/blob/master/project/twee/trait/_texts.twee#L555)

- Icon. [Example](https://gitgud.io/darkofocdarko/fort-of-chains/-/blob/master/dist/img/trait/subrace_werewolf.svg)

- Font. Can use Google Fonts for this.

- Company, unless the race is already extinct or extremely rare. This includes writing:
  - Company Ire events (minimum 3)
  - High-favor company event (rewards sex manual that unlocks some sex interactions)
  - A quest or two that can increase the company's favor
  - Some kind of reward if you have high favor with the company (need to be balanced, see Tiger Bank for baseline)

- **Many content**. Must have written down a significant chunk of related content to this subrace. This is because subracing still adds maintenance cost, so must only be done if supported by content. This does not always have to give units of this subrace -- mentioning them, or revolving around them also counts.

- A subrace of another race must still make sense in the context of the original race. For example,
dark elves are still elves, so it will still be fine when occasionally the game refers to dark elves as just elves.

**If you want to have a subrace added into the game**, do all the requirements first, including getting all the images
and writing out
the contents for them. Once that's done, the subrace can then be added into the game. Adding a subrace requires
a lot of effort from all parties involved, both writers and code maintainers.

As an example, tigerkins have:

- 26 images
- Its own lore thats intertwined with the world (i.e., as ancestors of the neko, and therefore is mainly found
as petrified statues in the western forests, from the ancient war between elves and tigerkins. Multiple quests
reference this)
- Many bodypart texts
- 4 quests (3 of them form a long quest chain), 3 events, and 2 opportunities (this is on the lower side, but tigerkins have been part of the game since the start so their bar is lower)
- And they are still basically neko, sharing many attributes with them. Treating tigerkins as neko will not cause writing or coherency problems.

Example races that probably would **not** be addable as a playable race:

- Mermaid, Lamia, Harpy, Drider, Centaur: too far from any of the existing races, difficulty coming up with nameset, bodypart function is too different than usual, causing writing issues

Example races that may be possible to be added as a playable race, if you contribute all the above properly:

- Kitsune / foxkin: wolfkin subrace. Nameset will be somewhat problematic though
- Goblins: greenskin subrace. Main issue is in finding portraits, especially female goblins. Will also require a lot of content and portrait, since they are common.
- Minotaur: demonkin subrace. Main issue is female portraits, as well as naming.

## Common Compiling Problems

- Make sure to [compile again](https://gitgud.io/darkofocdarko/fort-of-chains#compiling-instructions) each time you edit the file!

- Make sure you open `dist/index.html`, not `dist/precompiled.html`. Also, each time you compile, the `index.html` file will be re-generated and have to be re-opened.

- Make sure the file ends in `.twee`, e.g., `myquest.twee`. Some editor will append `.txt` to the end, so it becomes `myquest.twee.txt`. This will not work! Please ensure the file actually ends in `.twee`. (The only thing you need to do is rename the file.)

## Error: sessionStorage quota exceeded

This error is caused because your browser does not support `localStorage` or it allocates
too little to the `localStorage`.
Try these to fix:

- Quick hack: Disable `auto-save` from the in-game settings, and use `Save to Disk` and `Load to Disk` to save/load.
- Change your web browser. FireFox is a good option because they usually have a large limit on `localStorage` .
