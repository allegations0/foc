**Fort of Chains** is a completed, free, moddable,
[open-source](https://gitgud.io/darkofocdarko/fort-of-chains),
TEXT-ONLY
sandbox management NSFW game where you lead and manage a band of slavers in a fantasy world.
The game is configurable and can cover all gender orientations: MM, MF, and FF.
Be warned that the game contains heavy themes of slavery and non-consensual sex.
There are [no support](https://gitgud.io/darkofocdarko/fort-of-chains/-/blob/master/docs/faq.md#can-you-play-a-submissive-in-this-game)
for playing as a submissive character.
[(Feature / Fetish list)](https://gitgud.io/darkofocdarko/fort-of-chains/-/blob/master/docs/faq.md#does-this-game-contain-insert-fetish-here)

**Key designs.**
This game is designed to be a **short-story-teller** machine:
the core gameplay loop involves assigning groups of slavers to quests,
reading what happens to them, and finally reaping the quests' rewards.
This game is **complete**:
all features, bugfixes, polish, balancing, and originally planned stories are finished.
But improvements and community-made contributions are still being added continuously to the game.

**Contributing.**
The game is always looking for all and any kind of contributions.
More details [here](https://gitgud.io/darkofocdarko/fort-of-chains#how-to-contribute-content).
As of v1.7, more than 40 kind contributors have helped by directly adding content into the game,
while much more have helped playtest the game and give feedbacks.

(If you use Discord, you can tell us your discord name too so we can give you a Discord role,
which among other things allows you to bypass the seven days wait required there.)

and I can take a back seat as just a regular contributor :)

## How to Contribute Content

**Writers**
can contribute stories in the form of quests, events, etc.
It is very easy, and **no programming skill is required**!
Follow the in-game steps in the GUI-based `Content Creator Tool` (accessible
from the starting screen of the game).
See [submitting your content](#submitting-your-content) for more information
about what to do after you finish your content.

If you would like to contribute in another way, or if you need help
with implementing your quest,
please come over to
[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/PTD9D7mZyg), or open a new issue
in this repository.
(If you are a contributor and also on Discord, let us known your
discord ID here so we can give you a Discord role, which among other things allows you to bypass the
seven days wait there.)

**Programmers** are also welcome to contribute to the game -- merge requests
are always appreciated!
See [repository structure and code guidelines](docs/structure.md) to ease your entry into the project.

**Artists**, to add images into the game
(e.g., more portraits for units, images for quest / event outcomes, icons, panoramas, room images, and more), see
[this document](docs/images.md).
An option is to give the project permission to use some of your existing
artworks, which is greatly appreciated. The game will try its best to credit you properly.

## Compiling Instructions

The main benefit of compiling your game is that you can permanently add into the game and test
the content you have made with the Content Creator Tool.
Compiling is very easy to do, the instructions are as follows.

1. First, download this repository (top right button of this page), then open that directory

2. Step two depends on your operating system:
  - Windows
    1. Run `compile.bat`
    2. Open `dist/index.html` (Don't mistakenly open the adjacent `dist/precompiled.html`!)
  - Linux
    1. Ensure executable permissions on the following files by running:
      i. `sudo chmod +x compile.sh`
      ii. `sudo chmod +x dev/tweeGo/tweego_nix64`
      iii. `sudo chmod +x dev/tweeGo/tweego_nix86`
    2. Run `./compile.sh`
    3. Open `dist/index.html`
  - Mac
    1. Ensure executable permissions on the following files:
      i. `compile.sh`
      ii. `dev/tweeGo/tweego_osx64`
      iii. `dev/tweeGo/tweego_osx86`
    2. Run `./compile.sh`
    3. Open `dist/index.html`

That's it! The code is compiled. Note that you need to compile again
and reload the `index.html` file each time you make changes to the files.
See [here](https://gitgud.io/darkofocdarko/fort-of-chains/-/blob/master/docs/faq.md#common-compiling-problems)
for common problems you might encounter.

**If you are a programmer:** This compilation method only compiles the [twine files](https://gitgud.io/darkofocdarko/fort-of-chains/-/tree/master/project/twee),
and not the [javascript or css files](https://gitgud.io/darkofocdarko/fort-of-chains/-/tree/master/src).
To compile the javascript or css files, see instructions [here](docs/javascript.md).
To test the game / deploy the game, see instructions [here](docs/deploy.md).

## Submitting your Content

Once your quest is up and running, the final step is to add the quest
you've written into the game permanently, to be played by everyone.
This can be done in two ways:

#### The Discord Way

The first option is to drop the content in
the `#your-contribution` channel in
[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/PTD9D7mZyg).
Someone will then check that it fits the game, and
may give feedbacks.
Once the feedback loop is complete (if any), the content will be put it in the game.
(If you use Discord, you can tell us your discord name too so we can give you a Discord role,
which among other things allows you to bypass the seven days wait required there.)

#### Merge Request Way

The second option is to submit a merge request to this repository.
It is also very simple, and can be done without any programming knowledge.
See [submitting merge requests](docs/mergerequest.md) for a tutorial (with pictures!).
