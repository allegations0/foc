## Motivation

The unit cards looks ugly.


## Suggestion

Let's make the borders have images like in quest borders.


## Possible Cons

- Very time-expensive to do, may not actually be worth it

- May make slaver menu looks too crowded


## Possible Plan

1. Draw a new panorama for unit
2. Put the panorama in the card's CSS
